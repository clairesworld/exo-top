  abstract = {A large component of Earths atmosphere comes from the interior, where the gas species are dictated by the redox state of the mantle. After formation of Earths iron core, the mantle became several orders of magnitude more oxidized. Armstrong et al. conducted a set of experiments looking at the redox state of silicate melt representative of Earths early magma oceans. They found that at some depth, iron oxide disproportionates into iron(III) oxide and metallic iron. The reduced iron sinks to the core, leaving an oxidized rocky mantle that emits carbon dioxide and water instead of more reduced species.Science, this issue p. 903The composition of Earths atmosphere depends on the redox state of the mantle, which became more oxidizing at some stage after Earths core started to form. Through high-pressure experiments, we found that Fe2+ in a deep magma ocean would disproportionate to Fe3+ plus metallic iron at high pressures. The separation of this metallic iron to the core raised the oxidation state of the upper mantle, changing the chemistry of degassing volatiles that formed the atmosphere to more oxidized species. Additionally, the resulting gradient in redox state of the magma ocean allowed dissolved CO2 from the atmosphere to precipitate as diamond at depth. This explains Earths carbon-rich interior and suggests that redox evolution during accretion was an important variable in determining the composition of the terrestrial atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Mantle convection shapes Earth's surface by generating dynamic topography. Observational constraints and regional convection models suggest that surface topography could be sensitive to mantle flow for wavelengths as short as 1,000 and 250 km, respectively. At these spatial scales, surface processes including sedimentation and relative sea-level change occur on million-year timescales. However, time-dependent global mantle flow models do not predict small-scale dynamic topography yet. Here we present 2-D spherical annulus numerical models of mantle convection with large radial and lateral viscosity contrasts. We first identify the range of Rayleigh number, internal heat production rate and yield stress for which models generate plate-like behavior, surface heat flow, surface velocities, and topography distribution comparable to Earth's. These models produce both whole-mantle convection and small-scale convection in the upper mantle, which results in small-scale ({$<$}500 km) to large-scale ({$>$}104 km) dynamic topography, with a spectral power for intermediate scales (500 to 104 km) comparable to estimates of present-day residual topography. Timescales of convection and the associated dynamic topography vary from five to several hundreds of millions of years. For a Rayleigh number of 107, we investigate how lithosphere yield stress variations (10\textendash{}50 MPa) and the presence of deep thermochemical heterogeneities favor small-scale (200\textendash{}500 km) and intermediate-scale (500\textendash{}104 km) dynamic topography by controlling the formation of small-scale convection and the number and distribution of subduction zones, respectively. The interplay between mantle convection and lithosphere dynamics generates a complex spatial and temporal pattern of dynamic topography consistent with constraints for Earth.},

  abstract = {Metals observed in the atmospheres of white dwarfs suggest that many have recently accreted planetary bodies. In some cases, the compositions observed suggest the accretion of material dominantly from the core (or the mantle) of a differentiated planetary body. Collisions between differentiated exoplanetesimals produce such fragments. In this work, we take advantage of the large numbers of white dwarfs where at least one siderophile (core-loving) and one lithophile (rock-loving) species have been detected to assess how commonly exoplanetesimals differentiate. We utilise N-body simulations that track the fate of core and mantle material during the collisional evolution of planetary systems to show that most remnants of differentiated planetesimals retain core fractions similar to their parents, whilst some are extremely core-rich or mantle-rich. Comparison with the white dwarf data for calcium and iron indicates that the data are consistent with a model in which \$66\^\{+4\}\_\{-6\}\textbackslash\%\$ have accreted the remnants of differentiated planetesimals, whilst \$31\^\{+5\}\_\{-5\}\textbackslash\%\$ have Ca/Fe abundances altered by the effects of heating (although the former can be as high as \$100\textbackslash\%\$, if heating is ignored). These conclusions assume pollution by a single body and that collisional evolution retains similar features across diverse planetary systems. These results imply that both collisions and differentiation are key processes in exoplanetary systems. We highlight the need for a larger sample of polluted white dwarfs with precisely determined metal abundances to better understand the process of differentiation in exoplanetary systems.},

  abstract = {Current theories suggest that on Earth and, possibly, on other terrestrial planets early in their history, the first continental crust may has been produced by direct melting of hydrated peridotite. However, the conditions, mechanisms and necessary ingredients of such production remain elusive. To fill this gap, we have conducted experiments of serpentinite melting in the presence of variable proportions of basaltic melt, at typical conditions of the shallow lithosphere and asthenosphere. These experiments revealed formation of silica-rich liquids, which are similar to tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite magmas (TTG) identified in modern terrestrial oceanic mantle settings. Our results suggest a new mechanism of aqueous fluid-assisted partial melting of peridotite that may have operated on the early Earth and Mars just after the solidification of an ultramafic-mafic magma ocean, leading to the formation of the first embryos of continental crust. The proposed mechanism of the continental crust formation may have been predominant before the onset of plate tectonics.},

  abstract = {This chapter reviews the interior structure, chemistry, and dynamics of terrestrial planetary bodies: Mercury, the Moon, Venus, Mars, and Io. There are many processes that connect these aspects of planetary interiors, leading to the diversity of planetary surfaces and histories that we observe. Fundamentally, the dynamics of terrestrial bodies are driven by the transport of heat from the interior to the surface. Heat generation and transport are the processes that connect the structure and chemistry of a planetary body with its dynamic behavior, for example, volcanism, tectonism, and magnetism. The physical and chemical properties of planetary materials influence the mechanics of the planetary heat engine that drives dynamics, while the dynamics in turn alter the physical and chemical properties of a planet's interior. Parameterized, as well as fully dynamic, two- and three-dimensional models have been used for studying the thermal evolution of terrestrial planetary bodies. Many physical processes have been incorporated in these models, including complex rheology (with temperature, pressure, stress, and composition dependence), partial melting, crustal formation, core heat flux, and inner core growth. These models are compared with observations of crustal and lithospheric properties, magnetic fields, tectonism, crustal formation, and volcanic activity to constrain the present state and past activity of the terrestrial planets and satellites.},

  abstract = {Petrological analysis of the Martian meteorites suggests that rheologically significant amounts of water are present in the Martian mantle. A bulk mantle water content of at least a few tens of ppm is thus expected to be present despite the potentially efficient degassing during accretion, magma ocean solidification, and subsequent volcanism. We examine the dynamical consequences of different thermochemical evolution scenarios testing whether they can lead to the formation and preservation of mantle reservoirs, and compare model predictions with available data. First, the simplest scenario of a homogenous mantle that emerges when ignoring density changes caused by the extraction of partial melt is found to be inconsistent with the isotopic evidence for distinct reservoirs provided by the analysis of the Martian meteorites. In a second scenario, reservoirs can form as a result of partial melting that induces a density change in the depleted mantle with respect to its primordial composition. However, efficient mantle mixing prevents these reservoirs from being preserved until present unless they are located in the stagnant lid. Finally, reservoirs could be formed during fractional crystallization of a magma ocean. In this case, however, the mantle would likely end up being stably stratified as a result of the global overturn expected to accompany the fractional crystallization. Depending on the assumed density contrast, little secondary crust would be produced and the lithosphere would be extremely cool and dry, in contrast to observations. In summary, it is very challenging to obtain a self-consistent evolution scenario that satisfies all available constraints.},

In addition to the still limited precision on the planets' fundamental parameters, models are limited by the existence of degeneracies on their compositions. Here, we present a model of internal structure dedicated to the study of solid planets up to {$\sim$}10 Earth masses, i.e., super-Earths. When the measurement is available, the assumption that the bulk Fe/Si ratio of a planet is similar to that of its host star allows us to significantly reduce the existing degeneracy and more precisely constrain the planet's composition. Based on our model, we provide an update of the mass\textendash{}radius relationships used to provide a first estimate of a planet's composition from density measurements. Our model is also applied to the cases of two well-known exoplanets, CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b, using their recently updated parameters. The core mass fractions of CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b are found to lie within the 10\%\textendash{}37\% and 10\%\textendash{}33\% ranges, respectively, allowing both planets to be compatible with an Earth-like composition. We also extend the recent study of Proxima Centauri b and show that its radius may reach 1.94 in the case of a 5 planet, as there is a 96.7\% probability that the real mass of Proxima Centauri b is below this value.},

A series of 2D and 3D numerical experiments is described where a bottom heat flux is prescribed as well as a constant fraction of volumetric heating with either free-slip or no-slip conditions for the two horizontal boundaries. The assumption that hot plumes rising in the interior of the layer act as a volumetric heat source leads to a first order scaling of thermal boundary layers. Cases with a no-slip boundary agree well with this scaling while cases with free-slip systematically deviate: a decrease of 20\textendash{}30\% is observed for the temperature difference across the boundary layer when the fraction of heating from below is increased from 0 to 1. These differences are attributable to a velocity structure near the boundary varying with the fraction of volumetric heating. The main planetary implications are that (i) the average thermal structure of the bulk mantle and lithosphere are not good indicators of the distribution of heat sources between the interior (e.g. radioactive heating, secular cooling) and the lower interface (e.g. core cooling); (ii) in contrast, the nature of volcanism (whether it is localized, hot spot like or widespread) reflect this distribution and should thus help to constrain the global thermal structure as well as the existence of a magnetic dynamo.},

  author = {Daradich, Amy Louise},
  year = {2007},
  address = {{Canada}},
  abstract = {This thesis examines two distinct topics related to the long-term evolution of terrestrial planets. The first, dynamic topography, is the vertical motion of the Earth's tectonic plates in response to viscous stresses in the mantle driven by convective processes. Using mantle flow modelling, I show how dynamic topography linked to plate subduction can explain a long-wavelength component of sediment deposition in the Silurian Baltic Basin. Simulations constrain the paleo-dip angle of subduction to 40\textdegree\textendash{}60\textdegree{} and show that the slab-induced mantle flow mechanism provides 40\textendash{}85\% of the near-field sediment deposition. In another regional study, I use convection simulations constrained by seismic tomography to reconcile the observed broad tilting of the present-day Arabian platform that extends from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf. This area has been cited as a classic example of rift-flank uplift; however the influence of rift-flank processes is largely limited to uplift within a few hundred kilometers of the margin. Density heterogeneities linked to a megaplume, which are responsible for high topography in Southern Africa and rifting in East Africa, can reconcile the anomalous topography seen in Arabia.
The second topic in this thesis deals with the rotational stability of planets with lithospheres. Using an equilibrium rotational theory suitable for a planet with a lithosphere characterized by long-term elastic strength, along with observational constraints on the figure of Mars, I show that the current rotation axis of Mars is stable. I also find that development of the massive Tharsis volcanic province caused a re-orientation of the planet that was likely less than 15\textdegree{} and that the thickness of the elastic lithosphere at the time of Tharsis formation was at least {$\sim$} 50 km. Finally, I extend the equilibrium theory for a planet with an elastic lithosphere to consider the effect of a viscoelastic lithosphere on rotational stability. I find that for sufficiently high lithospheric viscosities (5\texttimes{}1024 Pa{$\cdot$}s or greater) a viscoelastic lithosphere can have a significant impact on reducing rates of true polar wander induced by an uncompensated load. These rates depend on the viscosity of the lithosphere and the size of the load.},

  abstract = {The characteristics of thermal convection in a fluid whose viscosity varies strongly with temperature are studied in the laboratory. At the start of an experiment, the upper boundary of an isothermal layer of Golden Syrup is cooled rapidly and maintained at a fixed temperature. The fluid layer is insulated at the bottom and cools continuously. Rayleigh numbers calculated with the viscosity of the well-mixed interior are between 106 and 108 and viscosity contrasts are up to 106. Thermal convection develops only in the lower part of the thermal boundary layer, and the upper part remains stagnant. Vertical profiles of temperature are measured with precision, allowing deduction of the thickness of the stagnant lid and the convective heat flux. At the onset of convection, the viscosity contrast across the unstable boundary layer has a value of about 3. In fully developed convection, this viscosity contrast is higher, with a typical value of 10.

  abstract = {Terrestrial-type exoplanets orbiting nearby red dwarf stars (M-dwarfs) are among the best targets for atmospheric characterization and biosignature searches in the near future. Recent evolutionary studies have suggested that terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of M-dwarfs are probably tidally locked and have limited surface water inventories as a result of their host stars' high early luminosities. Several previous climate simulations of such planets have indicated that their remaining water would be transported to the planet's permanent nightside and become trapped as surface ice, leaving the dayside devoid of water. Here we use a three-dimensional general circulation model with a water cycle and accurate radiative transfer scheme to investigate the surface water evolution on slowly rotating tidally locked terrestrial planets with limited surface water inventories. We show that there is a competition for water trapping between the nightside surface and the substellar tropopause in this type of climate system. Although under some conditions the surface water remains trapped on the nightside as an ice sheet, in other cases liquid water stabilizes in a circular area in the substellar region as a wetland. Planets with 1 bar N\$\_2\$ and atmospheric CO\$\_2\$ levels greater than 0.1 bar retain stable dayside liquid water, even with very small surface water inventories. Our results reveal the diversity of possible climate states on terrestrial-type exoplanets and highlight the importance of surface liquid water detection techniques for future characterization efforts.},

  abstract = {We aim to present a generalized Bayesian inference method for constraining interiors of super Earths and sub-Neptunes. Our methodology succeeds in quantifying the degeneracy and correlation of structural parameters for high dimensional parameter spaces. Specifically, we identify what constraints can be placed on composition and thickness of core, mantle, ice, ocean, and atmospheric layers given observations of mass, radius, and bulk refractory abundance constraints (Fe, Mg, Si) from observations of the host star's photospheric composition. We employed a full probabilistic Bayesian inference analysis that formally accounts for observational and model uncertainties. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, we computed joint and marginal posterior probability distributions for all structural parameters of interest. We included state-of-the-art structural models based on self-consistent thermodynamics of core, mantle, high-pressure ice, and liquid water. Furthermore, we tested and compared two different atmospheric models that are tailored for modeling thick and thin atmospheres, respectively. First, we validate our method against Neptune. Second, we apply it to synthetic exoplanets of fixed mass and determine the effect on interior structure and composition when (1) radius, (2) atmospheric model, (3) data uncertainties, (4) semi-major axes, (5) atmospheric composition (i.e., a priori assumption of enriched envelopes versus pure H/He envelopes), and (6) prior distributions are varied.

  abstract = {Astrophysical observations reveal a large diversity of radii and masses of exoplanets. It is important to characterize the interiors of exoplanets to understand planetary diversity and further determine how unique, or not, Earth is. Assessing interior structure is challenging because there are few data and large uncertainties. Thus, for a given exoplanet a range of interior structure models can satisfy available data. Typically, interior models aim to constrain the radial structure and composition of the core and mantle, and additionally ice, ocean, and gas layer if appropriate. Constraining the parameters of these layers may also inform us about interior dynamics. However, it remains challenging to constrain interior dynamics using interior structure models because structure models are relatively insensitive to the thermal state of a planet. Nevertheless, elucidating interior dynamics remains a key goal in exoplanetology due to its role in determining surface conditions and hence habitability. Thus far, Earth-like habitability can be excluded for super-Earths that are in close proximity to their stars and therefore have high surface temperatures that promote local magma oceans.},

  abstract = {The study of the thermal evolution of Earth's interior is uncertain and controversial in many respects, from the interpretation of petrologic observations used to infer the temperature and dynamics of the interior, to the physics and material properties governing heat transport. The thermal history of Venus is even more uncertain, but the lack of a dynamo at present in an otherwise similar planet may provide additional constraints on terrestrial planet evolution. In this paper a one dimensional thermal history model is derived that includes heat loss due to mantle melt eruption at the surface to explore its influence on the thermal and magnetic history of Earth and Venus. We show that the thermal catastrophe of Earth's mantle, which occurs for a present day Urey ratio of 1/3 and convective heat loss exponent of {$\beta$}=1/3, can be avoided by assuming a rather high core heat flow of {$\sim$}15TW. This core heat flow also avoids the new core paradox by allowing for the geodynamo to be thermally powered prior to inner core growth for core thermal conductivities as high as 130Wm-1K-1. Dynamo regime diagrams demonstrate that the mantle melt eruption rate has a minor effect on the history of mobile lid planets due to the efficiency of plate tectonic convective heat loss. However, if Earth were in a stagnant lid regime prior to 2.5Ga, as has been proposed, then at least {$\sim$}5\% of mantle melt is required to erupt in order to thermally power the paleodynamo at that time. Dynamo regime diagrams for stagnant lid Venus models indicate that more than half of the melt generated in the mantle is required to erupt in order to overcome the insulation imposed by the stagnant lid and drive a dynamo. This implies that with an Earth-like mantle radioactivity the Venusian dynamo shut down {$\sim$}0.3Ga for an eruption efficiency of 50\%, and {$\sim$}3Ga for an eruption efficiency of zero. Consequently, a stagnant lid alone does not prevent a core dynamo if melting of the upper mantle provides a substantial mantle heat sink.},

  abstract = {Most treatments of the Phanerozoic evolution of the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere (PCO2) assume a steady state closed system. Release of CO2 by mantle degassing and by biogenic precipitation of carbonates and their metamorphism in subduction zones balances the consumption by continental aluminosilicate weathering. Small perturbations in this balance bring about changes in PCO2, but given the small size of the atmospheric CO2 reservoir relative to the rate of fixation by weathering, mechanisms that maintain this apparently precarious balance dominate current thinking. At present, the Atlantic and Indian oceans are major depocenters of CaCO3, but subduction of ocean floor and the deposits on it is minimal in these basins. The locus of metamorphic regeneration of CO2 is restricted to the trenches off Central America. This is due to global asymmetries in the age of crust being subducted, in the distribution of oceanic carbonate productivity, and in the carbonate compensation depth, coupled with the poor preservation of old carbonate sediments. There is no causal relationship between the metamorphic release and weathering uptake of CO2 and subsequent deposition of carbonate on timescales shorter than a complete cycle of opening and closure of a basin. We hypothesize that the low present-day PCO2 is maintained by a time lag between: (1) mantle outgassing and metamorphic regeneration related to orogenic events in the geologic past, and (2) consumption driven by recent mountain building in the Tethyan zone and in the Western Americas. If this is true, then at the present `kinetic minimum' both the terrestrial biosphere and the weathering rates are CO2 limited. Atmospheric PCO2 levels are controlled by weathering reactions only at this limit. In epochs of tectonic stability, outgassed CO2 can accumulate in the atmosphere to very high concentrations with no obvious limit. Thus, as in the past, the current ice age will persist for tens of millions of years, possibly until the closure of the Atlantic recycles the first deep carbonate depocenter since the destruction of the Tethys. A greater understanding of all these processes is required for the geochemical evolution of the Earth surface environment to be simulated.},

Within strike-slip zones shear stresses in the lower lithosphere may also approach 50-100 MPa, though shear stresses in the upper crust of those regions are probably much lower. The relationship of tectonic style to surface elevation in the Andes and Tibet yields an estimate of about 5 x 1012 N m-1 for the force per unit length required to deform the lithosphere of these regions. This force per unit length is equivalent to an average shear stress of about 25 MPa through a lithosphere 100 km thick. The width-to-length ratios of active belts are consistent with deformation determined by the creep of the lower lithosphere rather than by friction on faults. The patterns of rotation of crustal blocks in western North America suggest that these blocks passively follow the deformation of a continuous substrate. The observations of deformation and the estimates of stress derived from them, both suggest that the upper continental crust is weak, relative to the lower parts of the lithosphere the deformation of which it follows passively. If this is so, determinations of stress in the upper crust may have only limited relevance to the deformation of the lithosphere as a whole.},

  abstract = {The secular cooling of the Earth's mantle and the growth of the 
continental crust together imply changes in the isostatic balance
between continents and oceans, in the oceanic bathymetry and in the area
of emerged continental crust. The evolution of these variables is of
fundamental importance to the geochemical coupling of mantle,
continental crust, atmosphere and ocean. To explore this further, we
developed a model that evaluates the area of emerged continental crust
as a function of mantle temperature, continental area and hypsometry. In
this paper, we investigate the continental freeboard predicted using
different models for the cooling of the Earth. We show that constancy of
the continental freeboard ({$\pm$} 200 m) is possible throughout the
history of the planet as long as the potential temperature of the upper
mantle was never more than 110-210 \textdegree{}C hotter than present. Such
numbers imply either a very limited cooling of the planet or, most
likely, a change in continental freeboard since the Archaean. During the
Archaean a greater radiogenic crustal heat production and a greater
mantle heat flow would have reduced the strength of the continental
lithosphere, thus limiting crustal thickening due to mountain building
processes and the maximum elevation in the Earth's topography [Rey, P.
F., Coltice, N., Neoarchean strengthening of the lithosphere and the
coupling of the Earth's geochemical reservoirs, Geology 36, 635-638
(2008)]. Taking this into account, we show that the continents were
mostly flooded until the end of the Archaean and that only 2-3\% of the
Earth's area consisted of emerged continental crust by around 2.5 Ga.
These results are consistent with widespread Archaean submarine
continental flood basalts, and with the appearance and strengthening of
the geochemical fingerprint of felsic sources in the sedimentary record
from \texttildelow{} 2.5 Ga. The progressive emergence of the continents as
shown by our models from the late-Archaean onward had major implications
for the Earth's environment, particularly by contributing to the rise of
atmospheric oxygen and to the geochemical coupling between the Earth's
deep and surface reservoirs.},

Plate tectonics plays a crucial role in driving the long-term carbon cycle because it is responsible for CO2 degassing at ridges and arcs, the return of CO2 to the mantle through subduction, and supplying fresh, weatherable rock to the surface via uplift and orogeny. However, the presence of plate tectonics itself may depend on climate according to recent geodynamical studies showing that cool surface temperatures are important for maintaining vigorous plate tectonics. Using a simple carbon cycle model, I show that the negative climate feedbacks inherent in the long-term carbon cycle are uninhibited by climate's effect on plate tectonics. Furthermore, initial atmospheric CO2 conditions do not impact the final climate state reached when the carbon cycle comes to equilibrium, as long as liquid water is present and silicate weathering can occur. Thus an initially hot, CO2 rich atmosphere does not prevent the development of a temperate climate and plate tectonics on a planet. However, globally supply limited weathering does prevent the development of temperate climates on planets with small subaerial land areas and large total CO2 budgets because supply limited weathering lacks stabilizing climate feedbacks. Planets in the supply limited regime may become inhospitable for life and could experience significant water loss. Supply limited weathering is less likely on plate tectonic planets because plate tectonics promotes high erosion rates and thus a greater supply of bedrock to the surface.},

Melting in the mantle during convection leads to the formation of a compositionally buoyant lithosphere, which may also be intrinsically more viscous by dehydration. The consequences of these melting effects on the evolution of terrestrial planets have not been explored before. The temporal evolution of crust and lithospheric mantle is modeled in a self-consistent manner considering mantle melting, convective instability, and the rewetting of dehydrated lithosphere from below by hydrogen diffusion. Though the effect of compositional buoyancy turns out to be minimal, the introduction of viscosity contrast between wet and dry mantle can considerably slow mantle cooling and sometimes lead to non-monotonic core cooling. Furthermore, with or without dehydration stiffening, our model predicts that the martian mantle must have been degassed more extensively ({$>$}80\%) than previously suggested ({$<$}10\%); the loss of such a large amount of water from the mantle to surface has significant implications about the role of water in the early surface and climate evolution of Mars.},

planetary surficial chemistry and how it may have varied among planetary
systems remains imprecise. A large number of factors are likely to be
involved in the control of magmatic gas compositions, leading roles
being given to the redox state and volatile abundances in planetary
interiors, and the fate of the latter during mantle melting. We however
show that the pressure at which degassing occurs, that is the
atmospheric pressure in most sensible cases, has a prime influence on
the composition of subaerial volcanic gases on planets: high surface
pressure produces N2- and CO2-rich and dry
volcanic gases, while low pressure promotes sulfur-rich gases.
In-between, atmospheric pressures close to 1 bar trigger volcanic gases
dominated by H2O. This simple pattern broadly mirrors the
atmospheres of Venus-Earth-Mars-Io planetary suite and constitutes
benchmarks for the prediction and interpretation of atmospheric features
of extra-solar planets. Volatile abundances within the planetary body
interiors also matter but they play a secondary role. Furthermore, our
analysis shows that any difference in redox conditions prevailing during
partial melting tends to disappear with the degassing process itself,
converging toward a unique - planetary oxygen fugacity - at the venting
pressure.

A feedback relationship between volcanic gas compositions and
atmospheric pressure implies a runaway drying during atmospheric growth;
that is volcanic gases must become CO2 richer as the
atmospheric mass increases. This may explain some features of the
Venusian atmosphere. On Earth, impact ejection of the atmosphere and
CO2-sink mechanisms, such as carbonate precipitation and
plate tectonics, must have decreased atmospheric pressure allowing the
reestablishment of water-rich volcanic gases.},

Other recent studies have treated only the heating from below, but volumetric heating is likely to be the dominant mode of heating in planetary mantles, either as a consequence of radioactive heating or as a proxy for secular cooling. Convection can occur either in the whole box or be located under a stagnant lid. In the lid regime, convection is driven by a temperature contrast depending on the rheology of the fluid and the interior temperature. This result, in agreement with experimental studies, indicates that boundary between the stagnant lid and the convecting layer (similar to the lithosphere-convecting mantle boundary) cannot be defined as a fixed isotherm. During thermal evolution of planets, the viscosity contrast in the convecting mantle remains constant, not the temperature at the bottom of the lithosphere. We present an example showing that the evolution of planets is strongly dependent on the criterion chosen to define the lithosphere-convecting mantle boundary. For reasonable values of the activation energy for thermally activated creep, the temperature defining the lithosphere-convecting mantle boundary, the mantle temperature, and the thickness of the lithosphere could be larger than expected from previous models which treat the base of the lithosphere as a fixed isotherm.},

A phase of rapid lithospheric growth is observed during the Hesperian and we propose that this elastic thickness history is a consequence of the martian crustal rheology and its thermal evolution. A wet crustal rheology is found to generate a mechanically incompetent layer in the lower crust during the early evolution and the rapid growth of Te during the Hesperian results from the disappearance of this layer due to planetary cooling. The incompetent layer and the related rapid lithospheric growth are absent for a dry basaltic crustal rheology, which is therefore incompatible with the observations. Furthermore, we find that the observed elastic thickness evolution is best compatible with a wet mantle rheology, although a dry mantle cannot be ruled out. It therefore seems likely that rheologically significant amounts of water were retained in the Martian crust and mantle after planetary accretion.},

Using a parameterized thermo-chemical evolution model and considering two end-member melting models, we self-consistently calculate the amount of CO2 and H2O outgassed during the martian evolution. Outgassing rates are found to depend primarily on a factor describing the outgassing efficiency, the bulk mantle water content, the mantle oxygen fugacity, and the local melt fraction in the magma source regions. We find that significant outgassing ceased around 3.5\textendash{}2Gyr ago, depending on the adopted melting model. A total of 0.9\textendash{}1bar CO2 is outgassed during this time period if a mantle oxygen fugacity corresponding to one log10 unit above the iron\textendash{}wustite buffer is assumed. Additionally, a total of 17\textendash{}61m of water is delivered to the surface. Outgassing is most efficient in the pre-Noachian (up to 4.1Gyr), but still significant during the Noachian, and 5\textendash{}15m of water and {$\sim$}250mbar of CO2 are outgassed between 4.1 and 3.7Gyr. Although this amount is probably insufficient for an appreciable greenhouse effect, pressures are found to be sufficient to stabilize transient liquid water on the surface well into the Hesperian period. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis that rather than being warm-and-wet, the martian climate was probably cold-and-wet. Outgassing is found to strongly decline during the Hesperian, and is insignificant during the Amazonian period. A simple parameterization for the outgassing of CO2 and H2O as a function of time is presented.},

  abstract = {Contrasting results on the magnitude of the dynamic component of topography motivate us to analyse the sources of uncertainties affecting long wavelength topography modelling. We obtain a range of mantle density structures from thermo-chemical interpretation of available seismic tomography models. We account for pressure, temperature and compositional effects as inferred by mineral physics to relate seismic velocity with density. Mantle density models are coupled to crustal density distributions obtained with a similar methodology. We compute isostatic topography and associated residual topography maps and perform instantaneous mantle flow modelling to calculate the dynamic topography. We explore the effects of proposed mantle 1-D viscosities and also test a 3D pressure- and temperature-dependent viscosity model. We find that the patterns of residual and dynamic topography are robust, with an average correlation coefficient (r) of respectively {$\sim$}0.74 and {$\sim$}0.71, upper-lower quartile ranges of 0.86\textendash{}0.65 for residual topography and 0.83\textendash{}0.62 for dynamic topography maps. The amplitudes are, on the contrary, poorly constrained. For the static component, the inferred density models of lithospheric mantle give an interquartile range of isostatic topography that is always higher than 100m, reaching 1.7km in some locations, and averaging {$\sim$}720m. Crustal density models satisfying the same compressional velocity structure lead to variations in isostatic topography averaging 350m, with peaks of 1km in thick crustal regions, and always higher than 100m. The uncertainties on isostatic topography are strong enough to mask, if present, the contribution of mantle convection to surface topography. For the dynamic component, we obtain a peak-to-peak dynamic topography amplitude exceeding 3km for all our mantle density and viscosity models. These extremely high values would be associated with a magnitude of geoid undulations that is not in agreement with observations. Considering chemical heterogeneities in correspondence with the lower mantle Large Low Shear wave Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) helps to decrease the peak-to-peak amplitudes of dynamic topography and geoid, but significantly reduces the correlation between synthetic and observed geoid. The correlation coefficients between all our residual and dynamic topography maps (a total of 220 and 198, respectively) is {$<$}0.55 (average={$\sim$}0.19). The correlation slightly improves when considering only the very long-wavelength components of the maps (average={$\sim$}0.23). We therefore conclude that a robust determination of dynamic topography is not feasible since current uncertainties affecting crustal density, mantle density and mantle viscosity are still too large. A truly interdisciplinary approach, combining constraints from the geological record with a multi-methodological interpretation of geophysical observations, is required to tackle the challenging task of linking the surface topography to deep processes.},

In the Solar System, Venus has a similar size and bulk composition to those of Earth, but it lacks water. Because a richer variety of exoplanets is expected to be discovered, prediction of their atmospheres and surface environments requires a general framework for planetary evolution. Here we show that terrestrial planets can be divided into two distinct types on the basis of their evolutionary history during solidification from the initially hot molten state expected from the standard formation model. Even if, apart from their orbits, they were identical just after formation, the solidified planets can have different characteristics. A type I planet, which is formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, solidifies within several million years. If the planet acquires water during formation, most of this water is retained and forms the earliest oceans. In contrast, on a type II planet, which is formed inside the critical distance, a magma ocean can be sustained for longer, even with a larger initial amount of water. Its duration could be as long as 100 million years if the planet is formed together with a mass of water comparable to the total inventory of the modern Earth. Hydrodynamic escape desiccates type II planets during the slow solidification process. Although Earth is categorized as type I, it is not clear which type Venus is because its orbital distance is close to the critical distance. However, because the dryness of the surface and mantle predicted for type II planets is consistent with the characteristics of Venus, it may be representative of type II planets. Also, future observations may have a chance to detect not only terrestrial exoplanets covered with water ocean but also those covered with magma ocean around a young star.},

Freshly produced basaltic crust can be carbonated, but buried and sinking crust will be subject to metamorphic decarbonation.

Recent studies have suggested that bioactivity may have had an even deeper impact and may have caused a change in the redox-state of the mantle and provided a path for the formation of continents. We here present a numerical model that assumes that bioactivity increases the continental weathering rate and that relates the sedimentation rate to the growth of continents and to the hydration of the mantle using elements of plate tectonics and mantle convection. The link between these factors is provided by assuming that an increase of the thickness of the sedimentary layer of low permeability on top of a subducting oceanic slab will reduce its dewatering upon subduction. This in turn leads to a greater availability of water in the source region of andesitic partial melt, resulting in an enhanced rate of continental crust production, and to an increased regassing rate of the mantle. The mantle in turn responds by reducing the mantle viscosity while increasing the convective circulation rate, degassing rate and plate speed. We use parameters that are observed for the present Earth and gauge uncertain parameters such that the present day continental surface area and mantle water concentration can be obtained. Our steady state results show two stable fixed points in a phase plane defined by the fractional continental surface area and the water concentration in the mantle, one of them pertaining to a wet mantle and the continental surface area of the present day Earth, and the other to a dry mantle and a small continental surface area. When the sedimentation rate is reduced, both fixed points move and the area of attraction of the latter fixed point increases systematically. We conclude that if the presence of life has increased the continental weathering rate, as is widely believed, and led to the observables of a wet mantle and a continental surface coverage of roughly 40\%, an abiotic Earth would likely have evolved toward a dry mantle with a small continental surface area instead.},

  abstract = {The habitability of terrestrial planets is strongly affected by the 
long-term carbon cycle and by the global water cycle. On the one hand,
the carbon cycle, including degassing, weathering, and - in the case of
plate tectonics - subduction regulates the surface temperature. On the
other hand, the water cycle regulates the distribution of water between
the surface and the mantle, thereby influencing the weathering rate and
the mantle viscosity. Since the mantle viscosity affects melting
processes at depth and thereby the degassing rate, the water cycle feeds
back on the carbon cycle. The latter in turn feeds back on the water
cycle via the surface temperature. However, the interaction between the
carbon and water cycles has received little attention so far.

We present a model of the interior evolution of terrestrial planets in
the stagnant-lid and plate tectonics mode. The model is based on a
parameterization of the convective heat transport. The viscosity is
dependent on the mantle water budget and thermal state. The carbon cycle
model includes cycling between different reservoirs: sediments, crust,
mantle, atmosphere, and oceans. Volatile extraction is calculated based
on a parameterized model of mantle melting, and the recycling of
volatiles into the mantle accounts for the contribution of volatile-rich
sediments and crust. While plate tectonics recycles volatiles via
subduction, a transfer of volatiles into the mantle of a stagnant lid
planet can occur via weathering of basaltic crust, thickening of the
crust via volcanism, and crustal delamination.

We will present first results of planetary evolution models including
the carbon and water cycles as a coupled system. We will focus on the
differences of our results compared to models that treat both cycles
separately or neglect one of them. Finally, we will highlight the
similarities and differences in the evolutions comparing planets with

Results. The assumed relationship between the seafloor-weathering rate and the atmospheric CO2 or the surface temperature strongly influences the climate evolution for both tectonic regimes. For a plate tectonics planet, the atmospheric CO2 partial pressure is characterized by an equilibrium between ingassing and degassing and depends on the temperature gradient in subduction zones affecting the stability of carbonates. For a stagnant lid planet, partial melting and degassing are always accompanied by decarbonation, such that the combined carbon content of the crust and atmosphere increases with time. Whereas the initial mantle temperature for plate tectonics planets only affects the early evolution, it influences the evolution of the surface temperature of stagnant lid planets for much longer.
Conclusions. For both tectonic regimes, mantle cooling results in a decreasing atmospheric CO2 partial pressure. For a plate tectonics planet this is caused by an increasing fraction of subduction zones that avoid crustal decarbonation, and for stagnant lid planets this is caused by an increasing decarbonation depth. This mechanism may partly compensate for the increase of the surface temperature due to increasing solar luminosity with time and hereby contribute to keep planets habitable in the long-term.},

  abstract = {The existence of stabilizing feedbacks within Earth's climate system is generally thought to be necessary for the persistence of liquid water and life. Over the course of Earth's history, Earth's atmospheric composition appears to have adjusted to the gradual increase in solar luminosity, resulting in persistently habitable surface temperatures. With limited exceptions, the Earth system has been observed to recover rapidly from pulsed climatic perturbations. Carbon dioxide (CO2) regulation via negative feedbacks within the coupled global carbon-silica cycles are classically viewed as the main processes giving rise to climate stability on Earth. Here we review the long-term global carbon cycle budget, and how the processes modulating Earth's climate system have evolved over time. Specifically, we focus on the relative roles that shifts in carbon sources and sinks have played in driving long-term changes in atmospheric pCO2. We make the case that marine processes are an important component of the canonical silicate weathering feedback, and have played a much more important role in pCO2 regulation than traditionally imagined. Notably, geochemical evidence indicate that the weathering of marine sediments and off-axis basalt alteration act as major carbon sinks. However, this sink was potentially dampened during Earth's early history when oceans had higher levels of dissolved silicon (Si), iron (Fe), and magnesium (Mg), and instead likely fostered more extensive carbon recycling within the ocean-atmosphere system via reverse weathering\textemdash{}that in turn acted to elevate ocean-atmosphere CO2 levels.},

we revisit the global data analysis of Korenaga and Karato (2008, https://doi.org/10.1029/2007JB005100)
with a significantly improved version of their Markov chain Monte Carlo
inversion. Their algorithm, previously corrected by Mullet et al. to minimize
potential parameter bias, is further modified here to estimate more efficiently
interrun biases in global data sets. Using the refined Markov chain Monte
Carlo inversion technique, we simultaneously analyze experimental data on the
deformation of olivine aggregates compiled from different studies.
Realistic composite rheological models, including both diffusion and
dislocation creep, are adopted, and the role of dislocation-accommodated
grain boundary sliding is also investigated. Furthermore, the influence
of interrun biases on inversion results is studied using experimental
and synthetic data. Our analysis shows that existing data can tightly
constrain the grain-size exponent for diffusion creep at \texttildelow{}2, which
is different from the value commonly assumed (p = 3). Different data
sets and model assumptions, however, yield nonoverlapping estimates on
other flow-law parameters, and the flow-law parameters for grain
boundary sliding are poorly resolved in most cases. We thus provide a
few plausible candidate flow-law models for olivine rheology to
facilitate future geodynamic modeling. The availability of more data
that explore a wider range of experimental conditions, especially higher
pressures, is essential to improve our understanding of upper mantle
rheology.},

Each of these mechanisms could play a role in compensating topography on Venus, and we distinguish between these mechanisms in part by calculating geoid-to-topography ratios and apparent depths of compensation. By simultaneously inverting for mass anomalies at two depths, we solve for the spatial distribution of crustal thickness and a similar map of mass anomalies in the mantle, thus separating the effects of shallow and deep compensation mechanisms on the geoid. The roughly circular regions of mantle mass deficit coincide with the locations of what are commonly interpreted to be buoyant mantle plumes. Additionally, there is a significant geographic correlation between patches of thickened crust and mass deficits in the mantle, especially for spherical harmonic degree l {$<$} 40. These mass deficits may be interpreted either as lateral thermal variations or as Mg-rich melt residuum. The magnitudes of mass deficits under the crustal highlands are roughly consistent with a paradigm in which highland crust is produced by melting of upwelling plumes. The mean thickness of the crust is constrained to a range of 8\textendash{}25 km, somewhat lower than previous estimates.

Radial magnetic field anomaly values (Br) at 400 km altitude are greater than 25 nT over areas at elevations less than about 6 km, Br = 0 over areas at higher elevations where volcanism is also concentrated. Assuming that much of the uplift and magmatism of Tharsis postdates the crustal magnetic field, we hypothesize that the absence of radial field in the central part of the rise is related to enhanced heat flow from an underlying mantle plume. A parameterized mantle convection model, combined with a heat transfer requirement for crustal demagnetization and analysis of the dynamic topography provides restrictive and self-consistent constraints on the plume structure, excess temperature {$\Delta$}Tex and heat flux qp as well as the average elastic thickness de at Tharsis at the time of uplift. These results lead, in turn, to bounds on the long-term average magma supply from the mantle. {$\Delta$}Tex is found to be in the range 205\textendash{}240\textdegree{}C and upper bounds for de are 29\textendash{}40 km, depending on the magnitude of the dynamic topography. Assuming magnetite is the dominant magnetic carrier, these results imply also that the lower 50\textendash{}60\% of the crustal column is raised above the Curie temperature and thermally demagnetized.

Despite this importance, the history and cycling of nitrogen in the Earth system is poorly constrained over time. For example, various models and proxies contrastingly support atmospheric mass stasis, net outgassing, or net ingassing over time. In addition, the amount
available to and processing of nitrogen by organisms is intricately linked with and provides feedbacks on oxygen and nutrient cycles. To investigate the Earth system nitrogen cycle over geologic history, we have constructed a new nitrogen cycle model: EarthN. This model is driven by mantle cooling, links biologic nitrogen cycling to phosphate and oxygen, and incorporates geologic and biologic fluxes. Model output is consistent with large (2-4x) changes in atmospheric mass over time, typically indicating atmospheric drawdown and nitrogen sequestration into the mantle and continental crust. Critical controls on nitrogen distribution include mantle cooling history, weathering, and the total Bulk Silicate Earth + atmosphere nitrogen budget. Linking the nitrogen cycle to phosphorous and oxygen levels, instead of carbon as has been previously done, provides new and more dynamic insight into the history of nitrogen on the planet.},

In some cases, the precision of measurement of planet masses and sizes is approaching the theoretical uncertainties in planet models. An emerging picture explains aspects of the diversity of low-mass planets, although some problems remain: Do extreme low-density, low-mass planets challenge models of atmospheric mass loss? Are planet sizes strictly separated by bulk composition? Why do some stellar characterizations differ between observational techniques?

Here we show that global silicate weathering can be modulated by orogeny in three distinct phases. High, young mountain belts experience preferential precipitation and the highest erosion. As mountains are denuded, precipitation decreases, but runoff temperature rises, sharply increasing chemical weathering potential and CO2 drawdown. In the final phase, erosion and weathering are throttled by flatter topography. We conclude that orogeny acts as a capacitor in the climate system, granting the potential for intense transient CO2 drawdown when mountain ranges are denuded; the mechanism suggests such a scenario potentially happening 10\textendash{}50 \texttimes{} 106 years in the future.},

  abstract = {The longevity of deep continental roots depends critically on the rheological properties of upper mantle minerals under deep upper mantle conditions. Geodynamic studies suggest that the rheological contrast between the deep continental and oceanic upper mantle is a key factor that controls the longevity of the continental roots. Current understanding of rheological properties of deep upper mantle is reviewed to examine how a large enough rheological contrast between the continental and oceanic upper mantle develops that leads to the longevity of the deep continental roots. Based on the microstructures of naturally deformed deep continental rocks as well as on the observations of seismic anisotropy, it is concluded that power-law dislocation creep dominates in most of the deep upper mantle. Deformation by power-law creep is sensitive to water content and therefore the removal of water by partial melting to form depleted continental roots is a likely mechanism to establish a large rheological contrast. The results of experimental studies on the influence of temperature, pressure and water content on plastic flow by power-law dislocation creep are reviewed. The degree of rheological contrast depends critically on the dependence of effective viscosity on water content under ``wet'' (water-rich) conditions but it is also sensitive to the effective viscosity under ``dry'' (water-free) conditions that depends critically on the influence of pressure on deformation. Based on the analysis of thermodynamics of defects and high-temperature creep, it is shown that a robust estimate of the influence of water and pressure can be made only by the combination of lowpressure (b 0.5 GPa) and high-pressure (N 5 GPa) studies. A wide range of flow laws has been reported, leading to nearly 10 orders of magnitude differences in estimated viscosities under the deep upper mantle conditions. However, based on the examination of several criteria, it is concluded that relatively robust experimental data are now available for power-law dislocation creep in olivine both under ``dry'' (water-free) and ``wet'' (water-saturated) conditions. These data show that the influence of water is large (a change in viscosity up to {$\sim$} 4 orders of magnitude for a constant stress) at the depth of {$\sim$} 200\textendash{}400 km. I conclude that the conditions for survival of a deep root for a few billions of years can be satisfied when ``dry'' olivine rheology with a relatively large activation volume (N (10\textendash{}15) \texttimes{} 10-6 m3/mol)) is used and the substantial water removal occurs to these depths. High degree of water removal requires a large degree of melting in the deep upper mantle that could have occurred in the Archean where geotherm was likely hotter than the current one by {$\sim$} 200 K presumably with the help of water.},

Our study shows that a higher background heat flux leads to more relaxation at the surface and subsurface. By applying various viscous creep parameters for hydrous and anhydrous rheologies, we demonstrate that Mars's interior is wet to a certain degree, which is consistent with other estimates. Since craters and QCDs are distributed fairly equally on the surface of the Red Planet, this study provides a less regionally biased picture of the thermal history of early Mars than in previous studies. Based on our results, the ancient average background heat flux in the Northern Lowlands was higher than that of the Southern Highlands, which could indicate that whatever process formed the crustal dichotomy had a thermal signature at least through the middle Noachian.},

Such models are based on the assumption that the redox state of the upper mantle has not changed, so that volcanic gas composition has remained approximately constant with time. We argue here that this assumption is probably incorrect: the upper mantle was originally more reduced than today, although not as reduced as the metal arrest level, and has become progressively more oxidized as a consequence of the release of reduced volcanic gases and the subduction of hydrated, oxidized seafloor. Data on the redox state of sulfide and chromite inclusions in diamonds imply that the process of mantle oxidation was slow, so that reduced conditions could have prevailed for as much as half of the earth's history. To be sure, other oxybarometers of ancient rocks give different results, so the question of when the mantle redox state has changed remains unresolved. Mantle redox evolution is intimately linked to the oxidation state of the primitive atmosphere: A reduced Archean atmosphere would have had a high hydrogen escape rate and should correspond to a changing mantle redox state; an oxidized Archean atmosphere should be associated with a constant mantle redox state. The converses of these statements are also true. Finally, our theory of mantle redox evolution may explain why the Archean atmosphere remained oxygen-deficient until \textasciitilde{}2.0 billion years ago (Ga) despite a probable early origin for photosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Oxygenic photosynthesis appears to have evolved well before O2 levels increased in the atmosphere, at around 2.4 Ga. This has led to numerous suggestions as to what may have kept O2 suppressed and then eventually allowed it to rise. These suggestions include changes in the recycling of carbon and sulfur relative to water (or hydrogen), a switch from dominantly submarine to dominantly subaerial volcanism, gradual oxidation of the continents and a concomitant decrease in reduced metamorphic gases, a decline in deposition of banded iron-formations, a decline in nickel availability, and various proposals to increase the efficiency of photosynthesis. Several of these different mechanisms could have contributed to the rise of O2, although not all of them are equally effective. To be considered successful, any proposed mechanism must make predictions that are consistent with the carbon isotope record in marine carbonates, which shows relatively little change with time, apart from transient (but occasionally spectacular) excursions. The reasons for this constancy are explored here, but are not fully resolved. In the process of making these comparisons, a self-consistent redox balance framework is developed which will hopefully prove useful to others who may work on this problem and to astronomers who may one day try to decipher spectral signatures of oxygen on Earth-like exoplanets.},

  abstract = {Ancient Mars likely hosted oceans similar to those on Earth; however, such water is not presently observed on Mars. One possible explanation for the lack of present-day oceans is that surface water was transported into and stored within the interior of Mars throughout the geological history. As water can influence the rheological structure of the Martian lithosphere, we investigated the sensitivity of the elastic thickness of the lithosphere to water using recent laboratory data. Calculations indicate that the presence of water results in a significant decrease in elastic thickness relative to dry conditions at a given thermal structure. Gravity and topographic data acquired by the Mars Global Surveyor and other orbiters indicate a temporal change in elastic thickness during the geological history of Mars. The extremely thin elastic layer during the planet's early history can be explained by a water-rich rheological model, whereas a dry rheology can account for the relatively thick elastic layer inferred during the later evolution of Mars. Although thermal evolution of Mars has a large uncertainty, the strong sensitivity of elastic lithospheric thickness to water suggests possible sequestered water into deeper levels during the early history of Mars.},

  abstract = {Several arguments point out that at the end of planetary accretion, the core of Mars was likely to be much hotter than its mantle, resulting in the formation of a completely or partially molten thermal boundary layer at the base of the mantle. Here we address the following questions: How did the superheated core cool and what role did it play in the early mantle dynamics of Mars? We divide the coupled core-mantle evolution of early Mars into two stages. During the first stage, vigorous convection within the molten boundary layer removes the heat from the core so that the boundary layer expands up. As the boundary layer gets thicker, the temperature of the layer decreases. Eventually, the temperature of the molten boundary layer drops down to the temperature for the rheological transition (melt fraction \texttildelow{}40\%) within 100 years. This stage is
described by a parameterized convection approach. The second stage is modeled in spherical shell geometry using the fully three-dimensional finite element code CitcomS. A single plume (``superplume'')
forms by the instability of the thermal boundary layer. The superplume stage lasts much longer, on the scale of millions to hundreds of millions of years, depending on the mantle viscosity. During both stages of evolution the heat flux can easily satisfy the requirements for the dynamo.},

Understanding the thermal budget thus requires contributions from both geophysics and geochemistry. The purpose of this review is to elucidate various geochemical and geophysical arguments and to delineate the most likely thermal budget of Earth. While the bulk Earth Urey ratio is probably {$\sim$}0.35, the convective Urey ratio is estimated to be {$\sim$}0.2. That is, only {$\sim$}20\% of convective heat flux seems to originate from radiogenic elements at present, so the rest should be supported by secular cooling. A likely scenario for Earth's thermal history indicates that the peculiarity of today's significant imbalance between heat production and heat loss may result from the initiation of plate tectonics in the early Earth.},

  abstract = {Resolving the modes of mantle convection through Earth history, i.e. when plate tectonics started and what kind of mantle dynamics reigned before, is essential to the understanding of the evolution of the whole Earth system, because plate tectonics influences almost all aspects of modern geological processes. This is a challenging problem because plate tectonics continuously rejuvenates Earth's surface on a time scale of about 100\,Myr, destroying evidence for its past operation. It thus becomes essential to exploit indirect evidence preserved in the buoyant continental crust, part of which has survived over billions of years. This contribution starts with an in-depth review of existing models for continental growth. Growth models proposed so far can be categorized into three types: crust-based, mantle-based and other less direct inferences, and the first two types are particularly important as their difference reflects the extent of crustal recycling, which can be related to subduction. Then, a theoretical basis for a change in the mode of mantle convection in the Precambrian is reviewed, along with a critical appraisal of some popular notions for early Earth dynamics. By combining available geological and geochemical observations with geodynamical considerations, a tentative hypothesis is presented for the evolution of mantle dynamics and its relation to surface environment; the early onset of plate tectonics and gradual mantle hydration are responsible not only for the formation of continental crust but also for its preservation as well as its emergence above sea level. Our current understanding of various material properties and elementary processes is still too premature to build a testable, quantitative model for this hypothesis, but such modelling efforts could potentially transform the nature of the data-starved early Earth research by quantifying the extent of preservation bias.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue `Earth dynamics and the development of plate tectonics'.},

For that purpose, the statistics of height and slopes may be described by different tools, at local and global scale. We propose here to use the multifractalapproach to describe fields of topography. This theory encompasses height and slopes and other statistical moments of the field, taking into account the scale invariance. Contrary to the widely used fractalformalism, multifractals are able to describe the intermittency of the topography field. As we commonly observe a juxtaposition of rough and smooth topographies at a given scale, the multifractal framework seems to be appropriate for hypsometric studies. Here we analyze the data at global scale of the Earth, Mars, Mercury and the Moon and find that the statistics are in good agreement with the multifractaltheory for scale larger than  {$\sim$} 10~km. Surprisingly, the analysis shows that all bodies have the same fractal behavior for scale smaller than  {$\sim$} 10~km. We hypothesize that dynamic topography of the mantle may be the explanation at large scale, whereas the smaller scale behavior may be related to elastic thickness.},

Instabilities in the bottom thermal boundary layer develop into hot rising sheets of fluid, with a component of radial flow towards a central upwelling plume. The sheets form the "spokes" of the pattern, and the plumes the "hubs". Such a pattern of flow is expected to occur beneath plate interiors on Earth, but it remains a challenge to use observations to place constraints on the convective planform of the mantle. Here we present predictions of key surface observables (gravity, topography, and rates of melt generation) from simple 3D numerical models of convection in a fluid layer. These models demonstrate that gravity and topography have only limited sensitivity to the spokes, and mostly reflect the hubs (the rising and sinking plumes). By contrast, patterns of melt generation are more sensitive to short wavelength features in the flow. There is the potential to have melt generation along the spokes, but at a rate which is relatively small compared with that at the hubs. Such melting of spokes can only occur when the lithosphere is sufficiently thin (\$\textbackslash{}lesssim 80\$ km) and mantle water contents are sufficiently high (\$\textbackslash{}gtrsim 100\$ ppm). The distribution of volcanism across the Middle East, Arabia and Africa north of equator suggests that it results from such spoke pattern convection.},

  abstract = {It is generally assumed that continents, acting as thermal insulation above the convecting mantle, inhibit the Earth's internal heat loss. We present theory, numerical simulations, and laboratory experiments to test the validity of this intuitive and commonly used assumption. A scaling theory is developed to predict heat flow from a convecting mantle partially covered by stable continental lithosphere. The theory predicts that parameter regimes exist for which increased continental insulation has no effect on mantle heat flow and can even enhance it. Partial insulation leads to increased internal mantle temperature and decreased viscosity. This, in turn, allows for the more rapid overturn of oceanic lithosphere and increased oceanic heat flux. Depending on the ratio of continental to oceanic surface area, global mantle heat flow can remain constant or even increase as a result. Theoretical scaling analyses are consistent with results from numerical simulations and laboratory experiments. Applying our results to the Earth we find, in contrast to conventional understanding, that continental insulation does not generally reduce global heat flow. Such insulation can have a negligible effect or even enhance mantle cooling, depending on the magnitude of the temperature dependence of mantle viscosity. The theory also suggests a potential constraint on continental surface area. Increased surface area enhances the subduction rate of oceanic lithosphere. If continents are produced in subduction settings this could enhance continental growth up to a critical point where increased insulation causes convective stress levels to drop to values approaching the lithospheric yield stress. This condition makes weak plate margins difficult to maintain which, in turn, lowers subduction rates and limits the further growth of continents. The theory is used to predict the critical point as a function of mantle heat flow. For the Earth's rate of mantle heat loss, the predicted continental surface area is in accord with the observed value.},

It has been well noted in the literature that classic thermal history models predict a larger value. The extent of the discrepancy is considered significant enough to be deemed a paradox. The `Urey ratio paradox' has motivated a number of studies and some considerable debates. Classic thermal history models, and the majority of those that have followed, do not explicitly consider the effects of continents. For consistency, the present day observations they seek to match should be adjusted to account for continents. We use mantle convection simulations with continents to argue that the adjusted ratio shifts to 0.33\textendash{}0.76. Classic thermal history models predict a Urey ratio that, although at the high end, is within this range. This suggests that the `paradox' has been exaggerated. It also points toward a first-order role for continents in the Earth's thermal evolution},

  abstract = {The solid Earth system is characterized by plate tectonics, a low viscosity zone beneath plates (the asthenosphere), and long wavelength flow in the convecting mantle. We use suites of numerical experiments to show: 1) How long wavelength flow and the operation of plate tectonics can generate and maintain an asthenosphere, and 2) How an asthenosphere can maintain long wavelength flow and plate tectonics. Plate subduction generates a sub-adiabatic temperature gradient in the mantle which, together with temperature-dependent viscosity, leads to a viscosity increase from the upper to the lower mantle. This allows mantle flow to channelize in a low viscosity region beneath plates (an asthenosphere forms dynamically). Flow channelization, in turn, stabilizes long wavelength convection. The degree of dynamic viscosity variations from the upper to the lower mantle increases with the wavelength of convection and drops toward zero if the system transitions from plate tectonics to a single plate planet. The plate margin strength needed to initiate that transition increases for long wavelength cells (long wavelength flow allows plate tectonics to exist over a wider range of plate margin strength). The coupled feedbacks allow for a linked causality between plates, the asthenosphere, and the wavelength of mantle flow, with none being more fundamental than the others and the existence of each depending on the others. Under this hypothesis, the asthenosphere is defined by an active process, plate tectonics, which maintains it and is maintained by it and plate tectonics is part of an emergent, self-sustaining flow system that bootstraps itself into existence.},

In this paper, we use a statistical analysis to determine the characteristic maximum (threshold) radii for various compositions for exoplanets with masses up to 25 Earth masses (M {$\oplus$}). We confirm that most planets with radii larger than 1.6 Earth radii (R {$\oplus$}) are not rocky, and must consist of lighter elements, as found by previous studies. We find that planets with radii above 2.6 R {$\oplus$} cannot be pure-water worlds, and must contain significant amounts of hydrogen and helium (H\textendash{}He). We find that planets with radii larger than about 3 R {$\oplus$}, 3.6 R {$\oplus$}, and 4.3 R {$\oplus$} are expected to consist of 2\%, 5\%, and 10\% of H\textendash{}He, respectively. We investigate the sensitivity of the results to the assumed internal structure, the planetary temperature and albedo, and the accuracy of the determination of mass and radius. We show that the envelope's metallicity, the percentage of H\textendash{}He, and the distribution of the elements play a significant role in the determination of the threshold radius. Finally, we conclude that, despite the degenerate nature of the problem, it is possible to put limits on the possible range of compositions for planets with well-measured mass and radius.},

When the silicate-rich rocks and minerals in Earth's interior are uplifted and exposed to Earth's surface, they dissolve. On a geologic time scale, this chemical weathering process ultimately creates a sink for CO2, thereby influencing global temperatures. Maher and Chamberlain (p. 1502, published online 13 March) developed a theoretical framework for understanding the fundamental relationship between weathering, tectonics, and the geological carbon cycle. The analysis suggests that temperature plays less of a role in regulating chemical weathering\textemdash{}which is dependent on the balance of tectonic uplift and erosion\textemdash{}than runoff on continents and the time that silicate minerals are exposed to fluids. Plateaus in weathering fluxes with increasing runoff or temperature allows for the stabilization of atmospheric CO2 despite high rates of uplift or erosion.
Earth's temperature is thought to be regulated by a negative feedback between atmospheric CO2 levels and chemical weathering of silicate rocks that operates over million-year time scales. To explain variations in the strength of the weathering feedback, we present a model for silicate weathering that regulates climatic and tectonic forcing through hydrologic processes and imposes a thermodynamic limit on weathering fluxes, based on the physical and chemical properties of river basins. Climate regulation by silicate weathering is thus strongest when global topography is elevated, similar to the situation today, and lowest when global topography is more subdued, allowing planetary temperatures to vary depending on the global distribution of topography and mountain belts, even in the absence of appreciable changes in CO2 degassing rates.
Consumption of carbon dioxide through silicate weathering is regulated by the intensity of the hydrologic cycle.

  abstract = {A parameterized model of mantle convection that includes the effects of volatile exchange between the mantle and the surface reservoir and the softening of the mantle by the dissolved volatiles is used to study the thermal history of the Earth. It is assumed that the activation energy for temperature-dependent solid-state creep is a linear function of weight percent of volatiles. The mantle degassing rate is taken to be directly proportional to the rate of seafloor spreading which depends on the mantle heat flow. The rate of regassing also varies with the seafloor spreading rate, but it depends on other factors as well, including the mass of the atmosphere-hydrosphere system and the efficiency of volatile recycling through island arc volcanoes. Because the degassing/regassing rates are a function of convective vigor which is regulated by mantle volatile content (through the volatile dependence of viscosity), the devolatilization/revolatilization of the mantle is self-consistently calculated. Model results indicate that mantle degassing and regassing rates quickly equilibrate during an early stage of rapid Earth cooling and adjust to regulate a more gradual cooling of the Earth over most of geologic time. These adjustments occur in the first several hundred million years of Earth's history. Most of the net volatile release from the mantle (or in some cases, net volatile absorption into the mantle) occurs early, in accord with isotopic evidence for rapid formation of the atmosphere. The net mass of volatiles released from the mantle is easily comparable to that of Earth's oceans. When mantle viscosity depends on both volatile content and temperature, changes in volatile content are compensated by changes in temperature so that the mantle evolves with the viscosity and convective vigor required to transfer its internally generated heat. Thus, the mantle is hotter (colder) as a consequence of degassing (regassing) compared to a mantle with volatile-independent rheology. The ratio of internal heat generation to total heat flow (the Urey ratio) is regulated by the temperature dependence of viscosity; models with high initial Urey ratios build up high temperatures very rapidly, thereby enhancing heat flow and reducing the Urey ratio. Early volatile loss from the mantle leads to a more rapid buildup of high temperature; thus, the ``corrective'' heat flow occurs even faster. Due to these feedback effects, the present value of the Urey ratio cannot exceed unity.},

On the basis of these comparisons we estimate the thickness of the Martian elastic lithosphere (Te) required to support the observed topographic load since the time of loading. We convert Te to estimates of heat flux and thermal gradient in the lithosphere through a consideration of the response of an elastic/plastic shell. In regions of high topography on Mars (e.g., the Tharsis rise and associated shield volcanoes), the mass-sheet (small-amplitude) approximation for the calculation of gravity from topography is inadequate. A correction that accounts for finite-amplitude topography tends to increase the amplitude of the predicted gravity signal at spacecraft altitudes. Proper implementation of this correction requires the use of radii from the center of mass (collectively known as the planetary ``shape'') in lieu of ``topography'' referenced to a gravitational equipotential. Anomalously dense surface layers or buried excess masses are not required to explain the observed admittances for the Tharsis Montes or Olympus Mons volcanoes when this correction is applied. Derived Te values generally decrease with increasing age of the lithospheric load, in a manner consistent with a rapid decline of mantle heat flux during the Noachian and more modest rates of decline during subsequent epochs.},

Simple analytic expressions are obtained which accurately predict the behavior to a step decrease in the heat supply, and show that layering considerably increases the response time. The same arguments are applied to a planet consisting of spherical shells. They show that the response of the earth's heat loss to the decay of radioactive elements depends strongly on whether or not mantle convection extends from the core to the surface. If it does so, the surface heat flux is only about 50\% greater than the heat generation rate. However if upper and lower mantle convection occurs in two separate shells, as seismological and geochemical arguments suggest, the response time is increased. The present surface heat flux is then principally controlled by the thermal structure of the earth at the time it was formed. The best estimate of the present ratio of the heat loss to heat generation is about two, and this value is consistent with the behavior of an earth model consisting of a two-layered mantle overlying a core.},

The relevant geophysical observations are outlined, and geotherms then obtained from parameterized convective models. Experimental observations which constrain the solidus and liquidus at various pressures are described by simple empirical functions. The variation in melt fraction is then parameterized by requiring a variation from 0 on the solidus to 1 on the liquidus. The composition of the melts is principally controlled by the melt fraction, though those of FeO, MgO, and SiO2 in addition vary with pressure. Another simple parameterization allows the observed compositions of major elements in 91 experiments to be calculated with a mean error of 11\%, and those of TiO2 and Na2O to 0 3 \% . These expressions are then used to calculate the expected compositions of magma produced by adiabatic upwelling. The mean major element composition of the most magnesium-rich MORB glasses resemble the mean composition calculated for a mantle potential temperature Tf of 1280\textdegree{}C. Adiabatic melting during upwelling of mantle of this temperature generates a melt thickness of 7 km. The observed variations of the MgO and TiO2 concentrations in a large collection of MORB glass compositions suggest that extensive low pressure fractional crystallization occurs, but that its effect on the concentrations of SiOj, A12O3, and CaO is small. There is no evidence that normal oceanic crust is produced from magmas containing more than 11\% MgO. The mantle potential temperature within hot rising jets is about 1480\textdegree{}C and can generate 27 km of magma containing 17\% MgO.},

Estimates of Te vary from 70 km for Tharsis, 29 km for Elysium, to 14.5 km for the southern hemisphere, and show that the thickness of the Martian lithosphere increases with age as the radioactive isotopes of K, Th, and U decay. A simple parameterised model of the convective thermal history is used to estimate the temperature structure of the lithosphere, and shows that the base of the elastic layer has a temperature of 300{$\pm$}50\textdegree{}C, or similar to the value for terrestrial continents. In both cases the rheology is probably affected by the presence of water. The short wavelength behaviour of the gravity field allows the density of the rocks that form the topography to be estimated, and gives values of about 3.0 Mg/m3 for Tharsis and Elysium. This value is substantially greater than that of 2.7 Mg/m3 obtained for Earth, and is in agreement with estimates from SNC (Shergottites\textendash{}Nahklites\textendash{}Chassigny) meteorites of 3.3 Mg/m3. The density of the topography of Valles Marineris is only 2.35 Mg/m3, and suggests that ice may be present below the surface. In the heavily bombarded southern hemisphere, isostatic compensation occurs at wavelengths as short as 700 km, which requires the effective compensation depth to be no more than 10 km. The gravity field with wavelengths greater than 1500 km may be supported dynamically, by a plume rising beneath the Tharsis region. The difference in temperature between the solidus and the present areotherm is less than 250\textdegree{}C, so melt generation can occur in rising plumes.},

Also, it is now possible to handle a flow law composed of both parallel and sequential deformation
mechanisms, by using conjugate gradient search to determine scaling constants. We test the new inversion algorithm extensively using synthetic data as well as the high-quality experimental data of Bai et al. (1991) on the deformation of olivine single crystals. Our reanalysis of this experimental data set reveals that a commonly adopted value for the stress exponent (\texttildelow{}3.5) is considerably less certain than
previously reported, and we offer a detailed account for the validity of our new estimates. The significance of fully reporting parameter uncertainties including covariance is also discussed with a worked example on flow law prediction under geological conditions.},

Both dehydration-hydration processes and dehydration melting are included. We also assume the rheological properties of hydrous minerals and density reduction caused by hydrous minerals. Heat transfer due to mantle convection seems to be enhanced more effectively than water cycling in the mantle convection system when reasonable water dependence of viscosity is assumed, due to effective slab dehydration at shallow depths. Water still affects significantly the global dynamics by weakening the near-surface oceanic crust and lithosphere, enhancing the activity of surface plate motion compared to dry mantle case. As a result, including hydrous minerals, the more viscous mantle is expected with several orders of magnitude compared to the dry mantle. The average water content in the whole mantle is regulated by the dehydration-hydration process. The large-scale thermochemical anomalies, as is observed in the deep mantle, is found when a large density contrast between basaltic material and ambient mantle is assumed (4\textendash{}5\%), comparable to mineral physics measurements.

  abstract = {The planet formation environment around M dwarf stars is different than around G dwarf stars. The longer hot protostellar phase, activity levels and lower protoplanetary disk mass of M dwarfs all may leave imprints on the composition distribution of planets. We use hierarchical Bayesian modeling conditioned on the sample of transiting planets with radial velocity mass measurements to explore small planet mass\textendash{}radius distributions that depend on host star mass. We find that the current mass\textendash{}radius data set is consistent with no host star mass dependence. These models are then applied to the Kepler planet radius distribution to calculate the mass distribution of close-orbiting planets and how it varies with host star mass. We find that the average heavy element mass per star at short orbits is higher for M dwarfs compared to FGK dwarfs, in agreement with previous studies. This work will facilitate comparisons between microlensing planet surveys and Kepler, and will provide an analysis framework that can readily be updated as more M dwarf planets are discovered by ongoing and future surveys such as K2 and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite.},

systems ranging in age from 3.55 Ga to modern day were determined using
the redox-sensitive partitioning of V between liquidus olivine and
komatiitic/picritic melt. The combined set of the oxygen fugacity data
for seven systems from this study and the six komatiite systems studied
by Nicklas et al. (2018), all of which likely represent large regions of
the mantle, defines a well-constrained trend indicating an increase in
oxygen fugacity of the lavas of {$\sim$}1.3 {$\Delta$}FMQ log units from 3.48
to 1.87 Ga, and a nearly constant oxygen fugacity from 1.87 Ga to the
present. The oxygen fugacity data for the 3.55 Ga Schapenburg komatiite
system, the mantle source region of which was previously argued to have
been isolated from mantle convection within the first 30 Ma of the Solar
System history, plot well above the trend and were not included in the
regression. These komatiite's anomalously high oxygen fugacity data
likely reflect preservation of early-formed magma ocean redox
heterogeneities until at least the Paleoarchean.

The observed increase in the oxygen fugacity of the studied komatiite
and picrite systems of {$\sim$}1.3 {$\Delta$}FMQ log units is shown to be a
feature of their mantle source regions and is interpreted to indicate
secular oxidation of the mantle between 3.48 and 1.87 Ga. Three
mechanisms are considered to account for the observed change in the
redox state of the mantle: (1) recycling of altered oceanic crust, (2)
venting of oxygen from the core due to inner core crystallization, and
(3) convection-driven homogenization of an initially redox-heterogeneous
primordial mantle. It is demonstrated that none of the three mechanisms
alone can fully explain the observed trend, although mechanism (3) is
best supported by the available geochemical data. These new data provide
further evidence for mantle involvement in the dramatic increase in the
oxygen concentration of the atmosphere leading up to the Great Oxidation
Event at {$\sim$}2.4 Ga.},

Though this rough balance may be due to a feedback mechanism between mantle temperature and heat loss, it is difficult to see how such a mechanism can occur on timescales of 1 Ga or less when the upper mantle of the Earth is thought to be cooling at about 40\textdegree{}C Ga-1. On Venus a decrease in surface heat flux presumably occurred at the end of the catastrophic resurfacing event at {$\sim$}500 Ma. Parameterized convection models relate heat flux to Rayleigh number by the exponent {$\beta$}. Such models using a range of viscosities and values of {$\beta$} from 0.2 to 0.3 show that the effect of a sudden decrease in surface heat flux is to cause an independently convecting upper mantle to increase in temperature by 100\textendash{}500\textdegree{}C over 1 Ga, whereas, if whole mantle convection occurs, the temperature change is less than 60\textdegree{}C. An increase in mantle temperature of 200\textdegree{}C or more will affect mantle viscosity, lithospheric thickness and melt generation rate, all of which may affect the feedback mechanism.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The most likely places for finding life outside the Solar System are rocky planets, some of which may have surface conditions allowing for liquid water, one of the major prerequisites for life. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), play an important role for the surface temperature and, thus, the habitability of an extrasolar planet. The amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is in part determined by their outgassing from the interior. Method: We use a two-dimensional convection model to calculate partial melting and the amount of CO2 outgassed for Earth-sized stagnant-lid planets. By varying the planetary mass, we investigate the evolution of a secondary atmosphere dependent on the interior structure (different ratio of planetary to core radius). We further study the likelihood for plate tectonics depending on the interior structure and investigate the influence of plate tectonics on outgassing. Results: We find that for stagnant-lid planets the relative size of the iron core has a large impact on the production of partial melt because a variation in the interior structure changes the pressure gradient and thereby the melting temperature of silicate rocks with depth. As a consequence, for planets with a large core (a radius of at least 70\textendash{}75\% of the planet{${'}$}s radius), outgassing from the interior is strongly reduced in comparison to a planet with the same radius but a small core. This finding suggests that the outer edge of the habitable zone of a star not only depends on the distance from the star and thus the solar influx but also is further limited by small outgassing for stagnant-lid planets with a high average density, indicating a high iron content (e.g. Mercury and the recently detected exoplanets Kepler-10b and CoRoT-7b). This contradicts previous models that have assumed CO2 reservoirs being in principle unlimited for all planets. If plate tectonics is initiated, several tens of bars of CO2 can be outgassed in a short period of time \textendash{} even for planets with a large iron core \textendash{} and the outer boundary of the habitable zone is not influenced by the interior structure. It is, however, more difficult for planets with a thin mantle (in our test case, with a thickness of 10\% of the planet{${'}$}s radius) to initiate plate tectonics. Our results indicate that the interior structure may strongly influence the amount of CO2 in planetary atmospheres and, thereby, the habitability of rocky planets. To obtain better constraints on the interior structure accurate measurements of size and mass are necessary.},

  abstract = {Several numerical studies have been published in the past years speculating about the existence of plate tectonics on large exoplanets. They focus on aspects like the mass of a planet, the interior heating rate and the occurrence of water in the mantle. Different trends in the propensity for plate tectonics have been observed in particular when varying the planetary mass: with increasing mass the surface mobilization is found to be either more, equally or less likely than on Earth. These studies and their implications are, however, difficult to compare as they assume different initial conditions and parameter sets, and either neglect the pressure effect on the viscosity or assume a rather small influence of the pressure on the rheology. Furthermore, the thermal evolution of the planets (i.e. cooling of core and decrease in radioactive heat sources with time) is typically neglected. In our study, we use a 2D finite volume code and apply a pseudo-plastic rheology. We investigate how a strong pressure-dependence of the viscosity influences not only the convective regime in the lower mantle, but also in the upper mantle and hence the likelihood to obtain plate tectonics. We examine how our results change when either assuming a wet or a dry rheology or when employing different initial conditions, focussing on the initial temperature in the lower mantle and at the core-mantle boundary. We find that the initial temperature conditions have a first-order influence on the likelihood of plate tectonics on large exoplanets. For standard literature values for initial temperatures of super-Earths, surface mobilization is less likely than on Earth, for warm initial temperature the result is vice versa. Simulations that neglect the time-dependence of internal heat sources on the other hand tend to lead to an increasing likelihood of plate tectonics with increasing mass. Finally, our investigations suggest that a wet rheology does not necessarily favor plate tectonics, but \textendash{} depending on the reference viscosity \textendash{} may rather lead to a stagnant-lid regime.},

We perform thermal evolution simulations for generic terrestrial planets with masses ranging from that of Mars to 10 Earth-masses in the stagnant-lid regime, the most natural mode of convection with strongly temperature- dependent viscosity. Given considerable uncertainty surrounding the dependency of mantle rheology on pressure, we choose to focus on the end-member case of pressure-independent potential viscosity, where viscosity does not change with depth along an adiabatic temperature gradient. We employ principal component analysis and linear regression to capture the first-order systematics of possible evolutionary scenarios from a large number of simulation runs. With increased planetary mass, crustal thickness and the degree of mantle processing are both predicted to decrease, and such size effects can also be derived with simple scaling analyses. The likelihood of plate tectonics is quantified using a mantle rheology that takes into account both ductile and brittle deformation mechanisms. Confirming earlier scaling analyses, the effects of lithosphere hydration dominate the effects of planetary mass. The possibility of basalt-eclogite phase transition in the planetary crust is found to increase with planetary mass, and we suggest that massive terrestrial planets may escape the stagnant-lid regime through the formation of a self-destabilizing dense eclogite layer.},

  abstract = {The topography and gravity measurements from missions to Venus and Mars are among a few data available to constrain models of the interior structure and dynamics of these planets. These measurements reveal various intriguing features whose origins have generated debates in the planetary science community. On Venus, these include a high correlation between the long-wavelength topography and the geoid. A common
explanation is that the Venusian topography is a result of dynamic uplift caused by mantle convection (dynamic topography). Our analysis of convection models shows that in strongly temperature-dependent viscosity fluids, such as planetary mantles, the dynamic topography is actually small. The lithosphere is close to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium (thermal isostasy) and the largest contributions to topography and geoid anomalies come from the lithospheric thickness variations caused by sublithospheric convection. The Venusian topography and geoid can be fully explained by the thermal isostasy associated with lithospheric thickness variations and the compositional isostasy associated with crustal thickness variations. A prominent feature on Mars is the hemispherical dichotomy where the southern highlands stand several kilometers elevated above the northern lowlands. One of the most common explanations for its formation is that the dichotomy formed as a result of a giant impact in the northern lowlands. We show that the impact could have been on the opposite side of the planet. A sufficiently large impact can melt the mantle to such extent that upon isostatic adjustment and crystallization of the melted part of the mantle it forms a region of high standing topography (a megadome) instead of a crater. A
topographic low forms antipodal to the impact (a megabasin).},

  abstract = {Normal stresses associated with convection in a fluid layer, whose boundaries can deform, produce topography on those boundaries. When the equations of motion are linear, integral relations between topography on the boundaries and the temperature structure can be found as a function of wavelength. Expressions of this kind have been derived for the case of convection in a constant viscosity fluid when inertial effects are negligible. The total gravity anomaly is the sum of contributions due to the topography on the two boundaries and to temperature variations within the fluid, and similar integral relations between gravity and the temperature structure can also be derived. At wavelengths large compared to the depth the shape of the kernels in the integrals, particularly that for gravity, is sensitive to the boundary conditions used. The transfer function between gravity and topography is also characteristic of the boundary conditions at long wavelengths. In all the cases considered, there is a transition between short-and long-wavelength behavior which occurs at wavelengths proportional to the layer depth. If the bottom boundary can deform as well as the upper boundary, the gravity anomaly tends to zero at long wave-lengths as the gravity kernel tends to zero everywhere. The surface topography kernel is always zero at the bottom boundary. The lack of any significant surface expression produced by temperature variations near the bottom of the layer provides an explanation of the similar relationships between gravity and topography associated with the dissimilar temperature structures produced by different modes of heating. At least for cellular convection, surface topography and gravity anomalies largely reflect temperature variations in the vicinity of the upper thermal boundary layer. This is consistent with an explanation of geoid anomalies over mid-ocean swells in terms of convection beneath the lithosphere, where the lower part of the thermally defined plate acts as the upper thermal boundary layer of the convection.},

The geoid power spectrum plotted on a log-log scale shows a significant change in its slope at about degree 40, suggesting a transition from a predominantly dynamic compensation mechanism at lower degrees to an isostatic and/or elastic mechanism at higher degrees. We focus on the dynamic compensation in the lower-degree interval. We assume that (1) the flow is whole mantle in style, (2) the long-wavelength geoid and topography are of purely dynamic origin, and (3) the density structure of Venus' mantle can be approximated by a model in which the mass anomaly distribution does not vary with depth. Solving the inverse problem for viscosity within the framework of internal loading theory, we determine the families of viscosity models that are consistent with the observed geoid and topography between degrees 2 and 40. We find that a good fit to the data can be obtained not only for an isoviscous mantle without a pronounced lithosphere, as suggested in some previous studies, but also for models with a high-viscosity lithosphere and a gradual increase in viscosity with depth in the mantle. The overall viscosity increase across the mantle found for the latter group of models is only partially resolved, but profiles with a {$\sim$}100-km-thick lithosphere and a viscosity increasing with depth by a factor of 10\textendash{}80, hence similar to viscosity profiles expected in the Earth's mantle, are among the best fitting models.},

Widespread volcanic plains, derived from the broad upwellings of internally heated mantle convection, were continually erupted during the time of crustal plateau formation. Discrete volcanic rises, younger than crustal plateaus, formed over a thicker lithosphere, with less plume partial melting.

  abstract = {Mantle convection on Mars and Venus is likely to occur in the regime 
known as stagnant lid convection. We perform thermal boundary layer
analyses as well as finite element simulations of stagnant lid
convection with non-Newtonian viscosity (which is believed to be more
appropriate for the lithosphere and upper mantle) and discuss one
particular application of the results, the efficiency of heat transport
on the terrestrial planets. As in the case of Newtonian viscosity, the
efficiency of heat transfer in the stagnant lid regime is extremely low
compared to plate tectonics: For example, in the absence of plate
tectonics, the mantle temperature on Earth, which is already close to
the solidus, would be about 700-1500 K higher for the present-day value
of the surface heat flux. For Venus, the critical heat flux which can be
removed without widespread melting is only 10-20 mW/m2. For
Mars, it is 15-30 mW/m2. Therefore, there are no doubts that
in the absence of mobile plates, the mantle temperature would
significantly exceed solidus during planetary evolution. It is
hypothesized that this could cause one, or a combination, of two
possible processes: (1) differentiation of radiogenic isotopes into the
crust during early planetary magmatism and (2) initiation of some kind
of plate tectonics as a result of plate weakening due to melting.},

three-dimensional spherical shell geometry. The scaling relationships for convection induced stresses in the lid are also very similar to those obtained in two dimensions. This supports the idea that initiation of subduction in the stagnant lid convection regime requires a very weak lithosphere.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial planets evolve in part via partial melting and gravitational differentiation, and in part via fluid/rock interactions at the surface. Mass and energy transfers across their various envelopes depend on the mode of convective motion, which may involve stagnant or mobile lid systems, for which plate tectonics is a possible mode; one promoting the coupling between exogenic and endogenic envelopes. In the other hand, fluid/rock interaction at the surface depends on the planet hypsometry and availability of weathering agents such as liquid water. It also depends on fluid/rock interaction at mid-oceanic ridge and therefore on the mode of convection. Hence, from 4.54 to 2.5 Ga the interplay between deep and surface processes under the forcing of secular cooling was such that the Earth differentiation was non-linear with sudden crises that punctuated periods of relative quietness. The Earth secular cooling impacted on deep and surface processes through the modulation of the Earth's hypsometry. This modulation occurred via cooling and
strengthening of the lithosphere (Rey and Coltice, Geology, 2008), and via the deepening of oceanic basin, which lowered the mean sea level forcing the continents to emerge (Flament et al., EPSL, 2008). Stronger lithospheres are able to sustain higher orogenic belts and orogenic plateaux, the erosion of which lead to stronger fluxes towards the ocean. Secular strengthening and emergence conspired to enhance
weathering and erosion of the continents and therefore to enhance the geochemical coupling between the endogenic and exogenic Earth's
envelopes (Rey and Coltice, Geology, 2008). The shift to the aerobic world, at the Archean to Proterozic transition, took place at a time when exogenic envelopes recorded major shifts in composition (eg. Taylor and McLennan, Rev. of Geophys., 1995; Veizer and Compston, Geochem. Cosmochem Acta, 1976; Valley et al., Contrib. to Mineral. Petrol., 2005) that are consistent with the progressive exposure to erosion of large areas of felsic crust hitherto hidden under greenstone covers and/or under sea level. Silicate weathering and erosion is a very efficient sink for atmospheric CO2. It is therefore also very likely that the strengthening and emergence of the continental lithosphere was a very important factor contributing to both the cooling of the Earth's surface and oxygenation of the Earth's atmosphere. The transition from primitive to modern Earth has often been presented in the context of a major pulse of crustal growth and differentiation (Taylor and McLennan, Rev. of Geophys., 1995), superplume activity (Condie, PEPI, 2004), and/or mantle overturn and orogenic crisis (Stein and Hofman, Nature, 1994; Breuer and Spohn, Nature, 1995). However, in the context of continental emergence and strengthening, the shift to the aerobic world, at the Archean to Proterozic transition, may be linked to the time period when the Earth evolved its modern hypsometry, and when the Earth's exogenic and endogenic geochemical reservoirs became strongly coupled via higher erosion rates and fluxes toward the oceans.},

We compare results using literature values of the partition coefficients of Si and Ni, as well as new partition coefficients calculated using results from laser shock-induced melting of powdered metal-dunite targets at pressures up to 276 GPa, which approaches those found within the deep mantles of super-Earths. We find that larger planets may have little to no light elements in their cores because the Si partition coefficient decreases at high pressures. The planet mass at which this occurs will depend on the metal-silicate equilibration depth. We also extrapolate the equations of state (EOS) of FeO and FeSi alloys to high pressures, and present mass\textendash{}radius diagrams using self-consistent planet compositions assuming equilibrated mantles and cores. We confirm the results of previous studies that the distribution of elements between mantle and core will not be detectable from mass and radius measurements alone. While observations may be insensitive to interior structure, further modeling is sensitive to compositionally dependent properties, such as mantle viscosity and core freeze-out properties. We therefore emphasize the need for additional high pressure measurements of partitioning as well as EOSs, and highlight the utility of the Sandia Z-facilities for this type of work.},

This study aims to understand how much of the chemical diversity in the super-Earth population can arise from giant impacts during planetary formation. Planet formation simulations have only recently begun to treat collisions more realistically in an attempt to replicate the planets in our Solar System. We investigate planet formation more generally by simulating the formation of rocky super-Earths with varying initial conditions using a version of SyMBA, a gravitational N-body code, that incorporates realistic collisions. We track the maximum plausible change in composition after each impact. The final planets span a range of Fe/Mg ratios similar to the Solar System planets, but do not completely match the distribution in super-Earth data. We only form a few planets with minor iron-depletion, suggesting other mechanisms are at work. The most iron-rich planets have a lower Fe/Mg ratio than Mercury, and are less enriched than planets such as Kepler-100b. This indicates that further work on our understanding of planet formation and further improvement of precision of mass and radius measurements are required to explain planets at the extremes of this Fe/Mg distribution.},

  abstract = {Changes that occur on our planet can be tracked back to one of two energy sources: the sun and the Earth's internal energy. The motion of tectonic plates, volcanism, mountain building and the reshaping of our planet's surface over geologic time depend on the Earth's internal energy. Tectonic activity is driven by internal energy and affects the rate at which energy is tapped, i.e., the cooling rate of our planet. Petrologic data indicate that cooling did not occur at a constant rate over geologic history. Interior cooling was mild until \textasciitilde{}2.5 billion years ago and then increased (Figure 1). As the Earth cools, it cycles water between its rocky interior (crust and mantle) and its surface. Water affects the viscosity of mantle rock, which affects the pace of tectonics and, by association, Earth cooling. We present suites of thermal-tectonic history models, coupled to deep water cycling, to show that the petrologically constrained change in the Earth's cooling rate can be accounted for by variations in deep water cycling over geologic time. The change in cooling rate does not require a change in the global tectonic mode of the Earth. It can be accounted for by a change in the balance of water cycling between the Earth's interior and its surface envelopes. The nature and timing of that water cycling change can be correlated to a change in the nature of continental crust and an associated rise of atmospheric oxygen. The prediction that the rise of oxygen should then be correlated, in time, to the change in the Earth's cooling rate is consistent with data constraints.},

  abstract = {Thermal history models, historically used to understand Earth's geologic history, are being coupled to climate models to map conditions that allow planets to maintain life. However, the lack of structural uncertainty assessment has blurred guidelines for how thermal history models can be used toward this end. Structural uncertainty is intrinsic to the modeling process. Model structure refers to the cause and effect relations that define a model and are assumed to adequately represent a particular real world system. Intrinsic/structural uncertainty is different from input and parameter uncertainties (which are often evaluated for thermal history models). A full uncertainty assessment requires that input/parametric and intrinsic/structural uncertainty be evaluated (one is not a substitute for the other). We quantify the intrinsic uncertainty for several parameterized thermal history models (a subclass of planetary models). We use single perturbation analysis to determine the reactance time of different models. This provides a metric for how long it takes low-amplitude, unmodeled effects to decay or grow. Reactance time is shown to scale inversely with the strength of the dominant model feedback (negative or positive). A perturbed physics analysis is then used to determine uncertainty shadows for model outputs. This provides probability distributions for model predictions. It also tests the structural stability of a model (do model predictions remain qualitatively similar, and within assumed model limits, in the face of intrinsic uncertainty?). Once intrinsic uncertainty is accounted for, model outputs/predictions and comparisons to observational data should be treated in a probabilistic way.},

  abstract = {Multiple hypotheses/models have been put forward regarding the cooling history of the Earth. The search for life beyond Earth has brought these models into a new light as they connect to one of the two energy sources life can tap. The ability to discriminate between different Earth cooling models, and the utility of adopting such models to aid in the assessment of planetary habitability, has been hampered by a lack of uncertainty analysis. This motivates a layered uncertainty analysis for a range of thermal history models that have been applied to the Earth. The analysis evaluates coupled model input, initial condition, and structural uncertainty. Layered model uncertainty, together with data uncertainty and multiple working hypotheses (another form of uncertainty), means that results must be evaluated in a probabilistic sense even if the models are deterministic. For the Earth's cooling history uncertainty leads to ambiguity - multiple models, based on different hypotheses, can match data constraints. This has implications for using such models to forecast conditions for exoplanets that share Earth characteristics but are older than the Earth, i.e., it has implications for modeling the long-term life potential of terrestrial planets. Even for the most Earth-like planet we know of, the Earth itself, model uncertainty and ambiguity leads to large forecast spreads. Given that this comes from the planet with the most data constraints we should expect larger spreads for models of terrestrial planets in general. The layered uncertainty approach can be expanded by coupling planetary cooling models to climate models and propagating uncertainty between them to assess habitability from a probabilistic versus a binary view.},

In addition, unlike a conventional view, the viscosity in super-Earth planets is proposed to decrease with pressure when pressure exceeds 0.1 TPa. Employing 2-D-axisymmtric and 3-D-spherical control volume compressible models, we perform an investigation on the impact of deep mantle dissociation of postperovskite into oxides, in conjunction with variations of the mantle viscosity, on the degree of the deep mantle layering, and the consequences of this layering on cooling of the rocky planets similar to super-Earth GJ 876 d. Small-scale convection in a layer of thickness 500 km from which penetrative plumes originate, develops above the core-mantle boundary (CMB) in the models for which the viscosity at the dissociation transition depth and below is less than 1023 Pa{$\cdot$}s. Due to the buffering effect of this deep mantle layering, while the mean mantle temperature above the layer decreases, resulting in a viscosity increase above the layer, it increases in the layered region above the CMB. This leads to a further reduction in viscosity at the bottom of the mantle. The effect is enhanced with increasing the CMB temperature and the contrast in thermal expansivity. The cooling rate of the planet decreases in the layered models due to the buffering effect of this deep mantle transition, as well as the influence of the viscosity increase above transition depth.},

In this cycle, warmer temperatures speed silicate weathering and carbonate formation, reducing atmospheric CO2 and thereby inducing global cooling. Over long periods of time, cycling of CO2 into and out of the mantle also dynamically buffers CO2. In the mantle cycle, CO2 is outgassed at ridge axes and island arcs, while subduction of carbonatized oceanic basalt and pelagic sediments returns CO2 to the mantle. Negative feedback is provided because the amount of basalt carbonatization depends on CO2 in seawater and therefore on CO2 in the air. On the early Earth, processes involving tectonics were more vigorous than at present, and the dynamic mantle buffer dominated over the crustal one. The mantle cycle would have maintained atmospheric and oceanic CO2 reservoirs at levels where the climate was cold in the Archean unless another greenhouse gas was important. Reaction of CO2 with impact ejecta and its eventual subduction produce even lower levels of atmospheric CO2 and small crustal carbonate reservoirs in the Hadean. Despite its name, the Hadean climate would have been freezing unless tempered by other greenhouse gases.},

Geochemical analysis of Earth's oldest continental crust suggests
that subduction may have begun episodically about 3.8 to 3.2 billion

years ago, during the Hadean. Yet, mantle rocks record evidence for
modern-style plate tectonics beginning only in the late Archaean, about
3 billion years ago. Here we analyse the nitrogen abundance, as well as
the nitrogen and carbon isotopic signatures of Archaean placer diamonds
from the Kaapvaal craton, South Africa, which formed in the upper mantle
3.1 to 3.5 billion years ago. We find that the diamonds have enriched
nitrogen contents and isotopic compositions compared with typical mantle
values. This nitrogen geochemical fingerprint could have been caused by
contamination of the mantle by nitrogen-rich Archaean sediments.
Furthermore, the carbon isotopic signature suggests that the diamonds
formed by reduction of an oxidized fluid or melt. Assuming that the
Archaean mantle was more reduced than the modern mantle, we argue that
the oxidized components were introduced to the mantle by crustal
recycling at subduction zones. We conclude, on the basis of evidence
from mantle-derived diamonds, that modern-style plate tectonics operated
as early as 3.5 billion years ago.},

polymorphic phase transformations and post-transformation grain growth and can vary substantially. A simple scaling analysis demonstrates one particular feature of the interaction of rheology, convection and kinetics: the mantle resembles a temperature-dependent viscosity fluid with an extremely unusual apparent activation enthalpy for the
viscosity. It can take almost any value including negative so that hotter regions can have a larger viscosity or the averaged viscosity of the mantle can increase during Earth's secular cooling. This affects mantle dynamics and evolution and should also be taken into account in interpretating the viscosity variations in the mantle.},

  abstract = {The effect of strongly temperature-dependent viscosity on convection in the interior of Venus is studied systematically with the help of finite element numerical models. For viscosity contrasts satisfying experimental constraints on the rheology of rocks, Venus is likely to be in the regime of stagnant lid convection. This regime is characterized by the formation of a slowly creeping, very viscous lid on top of the mantle-Venusian lithosphere and is in agreement with the tectonic style observed on Venus. Stagnant lid convection explains large geoid to topography ratios on Venus by the thermal thinning of a thick lithosphere. The thickness of the lithosphere can be as large as 400\textendash{}550 km for Beta Regio and 200\textendash{}400 km on average. Geoid and topography data and experimental data on the rheology of rocks provide constraints on the viscosity of the mantle, 1020\textendash{}1021 Pa s; the convective stresses in the interior, 0.2\textendash{}0.5 MPa; the stresses in the lid, 100\textendash{}200 MPa; the velocity in the interior, 0.5\textendash{}3 cm yr-1; and the heat flux beneath the lithosphere, 8\textendash{}16 mW m-2. Parameterized convection calculations of thermal history of Venus are difficult to reconcile with a thick present-day lithosphere. However, a sufficiently thick lithosphere can be formed if a convective regime with mobile plates was replaced by stagnant lid convection around 0.5 b.y. ago. One of the possible explanations for the cessation of Venusian late tectonics is that during the evolution of Venus, stresses in the lid dropped below the yield strength of the lithosphere. This model predicts a drastic drop in the heat flux, thickening of the lithosphere, and suppression of melting and is consistent with the hypothesis of cessation of resurfacing on Venus around 0.5 b.y. ago.},

  abstract = {The relation between gravity anomalies, topography and volcanism can yield important insights about the internal dynamics of planets. From the power spectra of gravity and topography on Earth, Venus and Mars we infer that gravity anomalies have likely predominantly sources below the lithosphere up to about spherical harmonic degree l=30 for Earth, 40 for Venus and 5 for Mars. To interpret the low-degree part of the gravity spectrum in terms of possible sublithospheric density anomalies we derive radial mantle viscosity profiles consistent with mineral physics. For these viscosity profiles we then compute gravity and topography kernels, which indicate how much gravity anomaly and how much topography is caused by a density anomaly at a given depth. With these kernels, we firstly compute an expected gravity\textendash{}topography ratio. Good agreement with the observed ratio indicates that for Venus, in contrast to Earth and Mars, long-wavelength topography is largely dynamically supported from the sublithospheric mantle. Secondly, we combine an empirical power spectrum of density anomalies inferred from seismic tomography in Earth's mantle with gravity kernels to model the gravity power spectrum. We find a good match between modeled and observed gravity power spectrum for all three planets, except for 2{$\leqslant$}l{$\leqslant$}4 on Venus. Density anomalies in the Venusian mantle for these low degrees thus appear to be very small. We combine gravity kernels and the gravity field to derive radially averaged density anomaly models for the Martian and Venusian mantles. Gravity kernels for l{$\geqslant$}5 are very small on Venus below {$\approx$}800km depth. Thus our inferences on Venusian mantle density are basically restricted to the upper 800km. On Mars, gravity anomalies for 2{$\leqslant$}l{$\leqslant$}5 may originate from density anomalies anywhere within its mantle. For Mars as for Earth, inferred density anomalies are dominated by l=2 structure, but we cannot infer whether there are features in the lowermost mantle of Mars that correspond to Earth's Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs). We find that volcanism on Mars tends to occur primarily in regions above inferred low mantle density, but our model cannot distinguish whether or not there is a Martian analog for the finding that Earth's Large Igneous Provinces mainly originate above the margins of LLSVPs.},

These features are classified into groups based on their dominant morphology. Atla and Beta Regiones are classified as rift-dominated, Dione, western Eistla, Bell, and Imdr Regiones as volcano-dominated, and Themis, eastern Eistla, and central Eistla Regiones as corona-dominated. At several topographic rises, geologic indicators were identified that may provide evidence of uplifted topography (e.g., volcanic flow features trending upslope). We assessed the minimum contribution of volcanic construction to the topography of each rise, which in general represents less than 5\% of the volume of the rise, similar to the volumes of edifices at terrestrial hotspot swells. The total melt volume at each rise is approximated to be 104-106 km3. The variations in morphology, topography, and gravity signatures at topographic rises are not interpreted to indicate variations in stage of evolution of a mantle upwelling. Instead, the morphologic variations between the three classes of topographic rises are interpreted to indicate the varying influences of lithospheric structure, plume characteristics, and regional tectonic environment. Within each class, variations in topography, gravity, and amount of volcanism may be indicative of differing stages of evolution. The similarity between swell and volcanic volumes for terrestrial and Venusian hotspots implies comparable time-integrated plume strengths for individual upwellings on the two planets.},

Inferences of the interior structure are impeded by a fundamental degeneracy that exists between any model comprising more than two layers and observations constraining just two bulk parameters: mass and radius. In this work, we show that although the inverse problem is indeed degenerate, there exists two boundary conditions that enables one to infer the minimum and maximum core radius fraction, CRFmin and CRFmax. These hold true even for planets with light volatile envelopes, but require the planet to be fully differentiated and that layers denser than iron are forbidden. With both bounds in hand, a marginal CRF can also be inferred by sampling in-between. After validating on the Earth, we apply our method to Kepler-36b and measure CRFmin = (0.50 +/- 0.07), CRFmax = (0.78 +/- 0.02), and CRFmarg = (0.64 +/- 0.11), broadly consistent with the Earth's true CRF value of 0.55. We apply our method to a suite of hypothetical measurements of synthetic planets to serve as a sensitivity analysis. We find that CRFmin and CRFmax have recovered uncertainties proportional to the relative error on the planetary density, but CRFmarg saturates to between 0.03 and 0.16 once delta rho/rho drops below 1-2 per cent. This implies that mass and radius alone cannot provide any better constraints on internal composition once bulk density constraints hit around a per cent, providing a clear target for observers.},

  abstract = {The discovery of extra-solar ``super-Earth'' planets with sizes up to twice that of Earth has prompted interest in their possible lithosphere and mantle dynamics and evolution. Simple scalings suggest that super-Earths are more likely than an equivalent Earth-sized planet to be undergoing plate tectonics. Generally, viscosity and thermal conductivity increase with pressure while thermal expansivity decreases, resulting in lower convective vigour in the deep mantle, which, if extralopated to the largest super-Earths might, according to conventional thinking, result in no convection in their deep mantles due to the very low effective Rayleigh number. Here we evaluate this. First, as the mantle of a super-Earth is made mostly of post-perovskite we here extend the density functional theory (DFT) calculations of post-perovskite activation enthalpy of to a pressure of 1TPa, for both slowest diffusion (upper-bound rheology) and fastest diffusion (lower-bound rheology) directions. Along a 1600K adiabat the upper-bound rheology would lead to a post-perovskite layer of a very high ({$\sim$}1030Pas) but relatively uniform viscosity, whereas the lower-bound rheology leads to a post-perovskite viscosity increase of {$\sim$}7 orders of magnitude with depth; in both cases the deep mantle viscosity would be too high for convection. Second, we use these DFT-calculated values in statistically steady-state numerical simulations of mantle convection and lithosphere dynamics of planets with up to ten Earth masses. The models assume a compressible mantle including depth-dependence of material properties and plastic yielding induced plate-like lithospheric behaviour. Results confirm the likelihood of plate tectonics for planets with Earth-like surface conditions (temperature and water) and show a self-regulation of deep mantle temperature. The deep mantle is not adiabatic; instead feedback between internal heating, temperature and viscosity regulates the temperature such that the viscosity has the value needed to facilitate convective loss of the radiogenic heat, which results in a very hot perovskite layer for the upper-bound rheology, a super-adiabatic perovskite layer for the lower-bound rheology, and an azimuthally-averaged viscosity of no more than 1026Pas. Convection in large super-Earths is characterised by large upwellings (even with zero basal heating) and small, time-dependent downwellings, which for large super-Earths merge into broad downwellings. In the context of planetary evolution, if, as is likely, a super-Earth was extremely hot/molten after its formation, it is thus likely that even after billions of years its deep interior is still extremely hot and possibly substantially molten with a ``super basal magma ocean'' \textendash{} a larger version of the proposal of Labrosse et al.

Here, fully dynamic 2-D and 3-D models are employed to compute the interior thermal evolution using strong temperature-dependent viscosity, mixed heating with radioelement decay, spherical geometry. The results of these models are compared to those of parametrized models, where we distinguish between the upper thermal boundary layer (TBL) and the stagnant lid, in a Monte Carlo framework to derive scaling laws valid for the entire planet evolution. The upper TBL thickness depends on the Rayleigh number to the power {$\beta$}u, while the lid base is determined by the mantle temperature and the rate of viscosity change with temperature multiplied by a prefactor arh. By varying {$\beta$}u and arh we find that, although the heating conditions change as a function of time, the thermal evolution of a cooling planet in a stagnant lid regime can be represented by a wide range of combinations of arh and {$\beta$}u. Suitable fits are found for different values of arh and {$\beta$}u that vary depending on the model set-up. The observed relationship between suitable values of arh and {$\beta$}u is explained by a trade-off between the lid and the TBL thicknesses. Only when considering a specific definition of the stagnant lid thickness in 3-D simulations, suitable combinations for all models converge to specific values of arh and {$\beta$}u. Using a stagnant lid defined by the intersection between the depth axis and the tangent to the velocity profile at the depth corresponding to the maximum velocity gradient, we find best-fit values of 2.54 and 0.335 for arh and {$\beta$}u, respectively.},

  abstract = {Methods. We made use of a phenomenological approach to tidal heating. We computed the orbit averaged flux from both stellar and planetary (both thermal and reflected stellar) illumination. We then calculated subsurface temperatures depending on illumination and thermal conduction to the surface through the ice shell and an insulating layer of regolith. We adopted a conduction only model, ignoring volcanism and ice shell convection as an outlet for internal heat. In doing so, we determined at which depth, if any, ice melts and a subsurface ocean forms.
Results. We find an analytical expression between the moon's physical and orbital characteristics and the melting depth. Since this expression directly relates icy moon observables to the melting depth, it allows us to swiftly put an upper limit on the melting depth for any given moon. We reproduce the existence of Enceladus' subsurface ocean; we also find that the two largest moons of Uranus (Titania \& Oberon) could well sustain them. Our model predicts that Rhea does not have liquid water.
Conclusions. Habitable exomoon environments may be found across an exoplanetary system, largely irrespective of the distance to the host star. Small, icy subsurface habitable moons may exist anywhere beyond the snow line. This may, in future observations, expand the search area for extraterrestrial habitable environments beyond the circumstellar habitable zone.},

It is restricted to a limited number of samples and a variety of remote-sensing measurements of billions-of-years-old surfaces whose actual age is difficult to determine precisely. Combining these observations into a coherent picture of the thermal and convective evolution of the planetary interior represents thus a major challenge.

  abstract = {Context. Plate tectonics is considered a fundamental component for the habitability of the Earth. Yet whether it is a recurrent feature of terrestrial bodies orbiting other stars or unique to the Earth is unknown. The stagnant lid may rather be the most common tectonic expression on such bodies. Aims: To understand whether a
stagnant-lid planet can be habitable, I.e. host liquid water at its surface, we model the thermal evolution of the mantle, volcanic
outgassing of H2O and CO2, and resulting climate of an Earth-like planet lacking plate tectonics. Methods: We used a 1D model of parameterized convection to simulate the evolution of melt generation and the build-up of an atmosphere of H2O and CO2 over 4.5 Gyr. We then employed a 1D radiative-convective atmosphere model to calculate the global mean atmospheric temperature and the boundaries of the habitable zone (HZ). Results: The evolution of the interior is characterized by the initial production of a large amount of partial melt accompanied by a rapid outgassing of H2O and CO2. The maximal partial pressure of H2O is limited to a few tens of bars by the high solubility of water in basaltic melts. The low solubility of CO2 instead causes most of the carbon to be outgassed, with partial pressures that vary from 1 bar or less if reducing conditions are assumed for the mantle to 100-200 bar for oxidizing conditions. At 1 au, the obtained temperatures generally allow for liquid water on the surface nearly over the entire evolution. While the outer edge of the HZ is mostly
influenced by the amount of outgassed CO2, the inner edge presents a more complex behaviour that is dependent on the partial pressures of both gases. Conclusions: At 1 au, the stagnant-lid planet considered would be regarded as habitable. The width of the HZ at the end of the evolution, albeit influenced by the amount of outgassed CO2, can vary in a non-monotonic way depending on the extent of the outgassed H2O reservoir. Our results suggest that stagnant-lid planets can be habitable over geological timescales and that joint modelling of interior evolution, volcanic outgassing, and accompanying climate is necessary to robustly characterize planetary habitability.},

  abstract = {Mass-radius relationships for water-rich terrestrial planets are usually calculated assuming most water is present in condensed (either liquid or solid) form. Planet density estimates are then compared to these mass-radius relationships even when these planets are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit (around 1.06x the Earth irradiation for planets orbiting a Sun-like star), for which water has been shown to be unstable in condensed form and should rather form a thick H2O-dominated atmosphere. Here we use the LMD Generic numerical climate model to derive new mass-radius relationships appropriate for water-rich terrestrial planets located beyond the runaway greenhouse limit, i.e. planets endowed with a steam, water-dominated atmosphere. These new mass-radius relationships significantly differ from those traditionnally used in the literature. For a given water-to-rock mass ratio, these new mass-radius relationships lead to planet bulk densities much lower than calculated when water is assumed to be in condensed form. In other words, using traditional mass-radius relationships for planets that are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse limit tends to dramatically overestimate their bulk water content. In particular, this result applies to TRAPPIST-1b, c and d, that should not have more (assuming planetary core with a terrestrial composition) than 2, 0.3 and 0.08\% of water, respectively. In addition, we show with the example of the TRAPPIST-1 multiplanetary system that the jumps in mass-radius relationships (related to the runaway greenhouse transition) can be used to remove usual composition degeneracies in mass-radius relationships. Finally, we provide an empirical formula for the H2O steam atmosphere thickness that can easily be used to construct mass-radius relationships for water-rich, terrestrial planets located beyond the runaway greenhouse limit.},

  abstract = {{$<$}div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"{$><$}p{$>$}In this Chapter{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}One of the important aspects of geodynamics is the fluid behavior of the solid mantle. This behavior should not be a surprise since crystalline solid ice in glaciers flows freely. The similarity to ice in a glacier is that the ice is close to its melting point and rock in the mantle is close to its melting point. In both cases strongly temperature-dependent movement of crystal vacancies and/or dislocations leads to solid-state creep in a stress field. This strong temperature dependence controls the cooling of the Earth. As the amount of radioactive heat production decreases with time, the vigor of the mantle convection required to extract the heat decreases. This allows the mantle temperature to decrease and the Earth to cool, contributing significantly to the observed surface heat flow.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}In this chapter we consider other rock rheologies. Viscoelasticity combines the elastic and viscous behavior of solid rock. Viscoelasticity explains why rock can transmit shear waves (requiring elastic behavior) at short time scales and behave viscously (mantle convection) at long times. Viscoelasticity will also quantify the thickness of the elastic lithosphere as a fraction of the thickness of the thermal lithosphere. When large stresses are applied to the elastic lithosphere irreversible plastic deformation occurs. The result is the development of plastic hinges in the lithosphere at some subduction zones.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Introduction{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}At atmospheric pressure and room temperature most rocks are brittle; that is, they behave nearly elastically until they fail by fracture. Cracks or fractures in rock along which there has been little or no relative displacement are known as joints. They occur on all scales in both sedimentary and igneous rocks. Joints are commonly found in sets defining parallel or intersecting patterns of failure related to local stress orientations. The breakdown of surface rocks by erosion and weathering is often controlled by systems of joints along which the rocks are particularly weak and susceptible to disintegration and removal. These processes in turn enhance the visibility of the jointing. Igneous rocks often develop joints as a result of the thermal stresses associated with cooling and contraction. Columnar jointing in basaltic lava flows (Figure 7.1) and parallel jointing in granitic rocks (Figure 7.2) are examples.{$<$}/p{$><$}/div{$>$}},

We explore which aspects of bulk terrestrial planet composition and interior structure affect the chief observables of an exoplanet: its mass and radius. We apply these perturbations to the Earth, the planet we know best. Using the mineral physics toolkit BurnMan to self-consistently calculate mass\textendash{}radius models, we find that the core radius, the presence of light elements in the core, and an upper mantle consisting of low-pressure silicates have the largest effects on the final calculated mass at a given radius, none of which are included in current mass\textendash{}radius models. We expand these results to provide a self-consistent grid of compositionally as well as structurally constrained terrestrial mass\textendash{}radius models for quantifying the likelihood of exoplanets being ``Earth-like.'' We further apply this grid to Kepler-36b, finding that it is only {$\sim$}20\% likely to be structurally similar to the Earth with Si/Fe = 0.9 compared with the Earth's Si/Fe = 1 and the Sun's Si/Fe = 1.19.},

Recently described observational trends suggest that rocky exoplanets, that is, planets without significant volatile envelopes, are likely limited to {$<$}1.5 Earth radii. We show that given this likely upper limit in the radii of purely rocky super-Earth exoplanets, the maximum expected core-mantle boundary pressure and adiabatic temperature are relatively moderate, 630 GPa and 5000 K, while the maximum central core pressure varies between 1.5 and 2.5 TPa. We further find that for planets with radii less than 1.5 Earth radii, core-mantle boundary pressure and adiabatic temperature are mostly a function of planet radius and insensitive to planet structure. The pressures and temperatures of rocky exoplanet interiors, then, are less than those explored in recent shock-compression experiments, ab initio calculations, and planetary dynamical studies. We further show that the extrapolation of relevant equations of state does not introduce significant uncertainties in the structural models of these planets. Mass-radius models are more sensitive to bulk composition than any uncertainty in the equation of state, even when extrapolated to terapascal pressures.},

  abstract = {We present new modelling results for the internal structure and convective dynamics of large terrestrial (rocky) exoplanets. By going out to 20 Earth masses our results show that pressure and temperature can reach several Terapascal (TPa) and 10000~K respectively in the silicate mantle of these planets. Ab initio calculations have predicted that the main constituent magnesium-silicate mineral of the Earth's mantle can fully dissociate, in a stepwise fashion, into the oxides SiO2 and MgO under these P,T conditions (Umemoto et~al., 2017). Based on calculated properties of the new phases and phase transitions by Umemoto et~al. (2017) we have modelled the internal structure of large terrestrial planets with an Earth-like core mass fraction of 0.3 and one to twenty times the Earth's mass. We found that full dissociation into oxides occurs inside planets that are more massive than thirteen Earth masses when pressure at the core mantle boundary exceeds  {$\sim$}  2.4 TPa. Our modelling results of Rayleigh\textendash{}Benard mantle convection for exo-planets with mass values within the range 1\textendash{}20 Earth masses show strong differences in the internal structure and the convection dynamics between the different cases. First, due to the increasing internal pressure the number of phase transitions increases from zero in the smallest case to four transitions, with five layers of different mineral associations, for the larger planet cases  {$>$} 13M{$\oplus$}. The bottom layer of the latter case corresponds to the layer of oxides. Furthermore, from the modelling results we also observe three regimes of convective dynamics, with: (1) smaller planets ( {$<$}  {$\sim$} 4M{$\oplus$}), showing vigorous convection, (2) intermediate cases ( {$<$}  {$\sim$} 12M{$\oplus$}), with sluggish penetrative convection, concentred in a single shallow mantle zone of higher flow velocity, and (3) large planets, ( {$>$}  {$\sim$} 12M{$\oplus$}), showing vigorous convection in two zones near the top and bottom, separated by a high viscosity mid-mantle region mantle with sluggish convection. These convective regimes are directly related to the pressure effect on mantle viscosity, first increasing followed by a decrease due to pressure weakening. Here the mass of the planet is the control variable because it sets the mantle pressure range. For the larger planet cases including a bottom layer of oxides, weakened by the reduced viscosity, we observe vigorous convection and small scale structure in the deepest part of the mantle that interacts with the dissociation phase boundary. The third of the above convective regimes shows the important role played by penetrative convection in the interior of super-earths, as there are two actively convecting layers at the top and bottom, driving a slowly moving interior layer. This impacts the heat-flux from the core and the viability of core dynamo processes.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen is the most common element in Earth's atmosphere and also appears to be present in significant amounts in the mantle. However, its long-term cycling between these two reservoirs remains poorly understood. Here a range of biotic and abiotic mechanisms are evaluated that could have caused nitrogen exchange between Earth's surface and interior over time. In the Archean, biological nitrogen fixation was likely strongly limited by nutrient and/or electron acceptor constraints. Abiotic fixation of dinitrogen becomes efficient in strongly reducing atmospheres, but only once temperatures exceed around 1000 K. Hence if atmospheric N2 levels really were as low as they are today 3.0 \textendash{} 3.5 Ga, the bulk of Earth's mantle nitrogen must have been emplaced in the Hadean, most likely at a time when the surface was molten. The elevated atmospheric N content on Venus compared to Earth can be explained abiotically by a water loss redox pump mechanism, where oxygen liberated from H2O photolysis and subsequent H loss to space oxidises the mantle, causing enhanced outgassing of nitrogen. This mechanism has implications for understanding the partitioning of other Venusian volatiles and atmospheric evolution on exoplanets.},

The global crustal thickness is then calculated based on the isostatic component of the gravity and topography. The results show that some highland plateaus such as Ishtar Terra and Ovda Regio have thick crust, which are largely supported by isostatic compensation. Other highland plateaus such as Thetis and Phoebe Regiones appear to have superimposed contributions from crustal thickening and dynamic support. Volcanic rises such as Atla and Beta Regiones have thin crust, which is consistent with the postulation that these volcanic rises are mainly the products of dynamic uplift caused by mantle plumes.},

  abstract = {Plate tectonics is a geophysical process currently unique to Earth, has an important role in regulating the Earth's climate, and may be better understood by identifying rocky planets outside our solar system with tectonic activity. The key criterion for whether or not plate tectonics may occur on a terrestrial planet is if the stress on a planet's lithosphere from mantle convection may overcome the lithosphere's yield stress. Although many rocky exoplanets closely orbiting their host stars have been detected, all studies to date of plate tectonics on exoplanets have neglected tidal stresses in the planet's lithosphere. Modeling a rocky exoplanet as a constant density, homogeneous, incompressible sphere, we show the tidal stress from the host star acting on close-in planets may become comparable to the stress on the lithosphere from mantle convection. Tidal stress of this magnitude may aid mantle convection stress in subduction of plates, or drive the subduction of plates without the need for mantle convective stresses. We also show that tidal stresses from planet-planet interactions are unlikely to be significant for plate tectonics, but may be strong enough to trigger Earthquakes. Our work may imply planets orbiting close to their host stars are more likely to experience plate tectonics, with implications for exoplanetary geophysics and habitability. We produce a list of detected rocky exoplanets under the most intense stresses. Atmospheric and topographic observations may confirm our predictions in the near future. Investigations of planets with significant tidal stress can not only lead to observable parameters linked to the presence of active plate tectonics, but may also be used as a tool to test theories on the main driving force behind tectonic activity.},

While only the masses of the planets orbiting the brightest stars can be determined by ground-based spectroscopic observations, these observations allow calculation of their average densities placing constraints on the bulk compositions and internal structures. However, an important question about the composition of planets ranging from 2 to 4 Earth radii (R{$\oplus$}) still remains. They may either have a rocky core enveloped in a H2\textendash{}He gaseous envelope (gas dwarfs) or contain a significant amount of multicomponent, H2O-dominated ices/fluids (water worlds). Planets in the mass range of 10\textendash{}15 M{$\oplus$}, if half-ice and half-rock by mass, have radii of 2.5 R{$\oplus$}, which exactly match the second peak of the exoplanet radius bimodal distribution. Any planet in the 2- to 4-R{$\oplus$} range requires a gas envelope of at most a few mass percentage points, regardless of the core composition.

  abstract = {The Tharsis rise represents the most significant long-wavelength gravity 
and topography anomalies on Mars. Two competing models have been
proposed to explain the origin of these anomalies. In the first model
the Tharsis rise is attributed to loading of volcanic construction on
the lithosphere, while in the second model these anomalies are explained
as dynamic effects of a one-plume thermal structure below the Tharsis
rise. In this study we seek to distinguish between these two models by
formulating a generalized viscoelastic loading model that determines
responses to loads at different depths. With this new formulation we
found that the instantaneous viscous flow loading formulation used to
compute responses from a plume may significantly overestimate the geoid
anomalies if the elastic thickness of the Tharsis lithosphere is \textasciitilde{}150 km
as inferred from gravity and topography data. We suggest that the
one-plume structure if currently existing below the Tharsis rise may be
responsible for only a small fraction ({$<$}10\%) of the Tharsis geoid
anomalies and that other processes, including surface loading of
volcanic construction, may be the primary cause of the geoid anomalies.
The plume structure is inefficient in producing geoid anomalies because
the long-wavelength components of the plume structure are confined to a
\textasciitilde{}300 km layer below the lithosphere in which the geoid response is
minimal. Future studies on gravity and topography at different
wavelengths may put constraints on possible contribution of a plume to
the elevated Tharsis topography.},
