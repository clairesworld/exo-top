The thick black and grey lines are based on our thermal history model Venus case, using the \citet {Parsons1983} scaling (equation \ref {eq:PD83}) and the classical stress scaling (equation \ref {eq:dyn_top_stress}), respectively. The prefactor in the stress scaling is taken to be equal to 2. The pink circles show the minimum and maximum values (of a time-evolution) from \citet {Kiefer1998}, the magenta dashed line is the log-log fit from a numerical model (equation \ref {eq:KH92}) in \citet {Kiefer1992}, the lilac triangle is the Venus case from the power spectrum in \citet {Golle2012} for their instantaeous viscous flow case, and the yellow stars are the inferred dynamic topography from a number of individual features by \citet {Nimmo1996}.
