\section{Preliminary results}

\subsection{Thermal evolution}

\begin{itemize}
\item Figures comparing our thermal model to Thiriet and others in the literature for Venus/Mars parameters
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Purely-dynamic topography for solar system analogues}

This analysis results in values for dynamic topography which are rather far off from what is seen in the solar system. We can compare our results to Table \ref{tab:dyn_topo_obvs}...


\subsubsection{Variation of dynamic topography with planet mass}

\begin{itemize}
\item Figure plotting mass (x axis) versus RMS (y axis), maybe for different rheologies, with solar system data points marked
\end{itemize}
