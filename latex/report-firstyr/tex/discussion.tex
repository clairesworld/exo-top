\citet{Urey1955} shows how mantle viscosity could have a stabilizing feedback on temperature. Increasing temperature decreases viscosity, which increases Ra in (\ref{eq:Ra}). Increasing Ra is associated with a thinner thermal boundary layer and more heat flow out of the mantle (\ref{eq:q_Ra}), which in turn cools the mantle and raises its viscosity. This feedback would buffer the interior at a near-constant viscosity, a corollary of which is a narrow range for the mantle viscosities of terrestrial exoplanets. The feedback has not been proven to occur on Earth, and is not guaranteed; its efficiency depends the heat flux out of the mantle being able to adjust quickly to a change in temperature, with respect to the time scale of radiogenic decay \citep{Korenaga2008a}. This may not be the case if the upper mantle is very dehydrated, for example.



This negative feedback does appear to regulate viscosity in our model. Figure \ref{fig:rheology}a,b illustrates some trade-offs between thermal evolution output parameters and the input parameters in the Arrhenius law for viscosity,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eta_Arrhenius}
\eta_m(T) = b \exp\left(\frac{E_a}{R^* T_m}\right),
\end{equation}
where $R^*$ is the gas constant, $b$ is a prefactor, and $E_a$ is the activation energy in J mol$^{-1}$ \citep{Karato1993}. The prefactor is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eta_b}
b = \frac{\mu}{2 A_{rh}} \left(\frac{h_{rh}}{B}\right)^m,
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is the shear modulus in Pa, $A$ is a preexponential factor in s$^{-1}$ (of order $10^{15}$ for diffusion creep), $B$ is the Burgers vector in m (quantifying the distortion in the crystal lattice due to dislocation), $h_{rh}$ is the grain size of the rock in m, and $m$ is an exponent characteristic to the type of creep. We treat grain size $h_{rh}$ as a proxy for $b$.

Changing the dependence of viscosity on temperature pushes the planet to different temperature paths (figure \ref{fig:rheology}a,b), which are rapidly amplified, even if $\eta_m$ later converges across evolved runs to within an order of magnitude. The grain size sets how high $\eta_m$ is initially, and the activation energy controls how quickly $\eta_m$ changes with $T_m$. In both cases of either large grain size or high activation energy, the interior starts to lose heat out of the top less efficiently because of initially sluggish convection, and the planet maintains a higher $T_m$ in the quasi-steady state. 

Meanwhile, as predicted by boundary layer theory \citep{Solomatov1995, Reese2005}, the viscosity-law parameters (figure \ref{fig:rheology}a,b) have an insignificant effect on the final dynamic topography. This is due to the competing effects of Ra (via $\eta_m$) and thermal boundary layer thickness $\delta_{u}$ in equation (\ref{eq:dyn_top_stress}): the high-viscosity mantle with elevated $E_a$ has a smaller $\delta_{u}$.

The upper thermal boundary layer heat flux $q_{u}$ acts as a regulation mechanism in that it is anticorrelated with $\Delta h$ and $\eta_m$. For a given quasi-steady state value of $q_{u}$, the rheological temperature scale $\Delta T_{rh}$ multiplied by a constant $a_{rh}$ sets the temperature contrast across the thermal boundary layer, dictating how thick $\delta_{u}$ can be (equation \ref{eq:q_Ra}). As shown in figure \ref{fig:rheology}c, doubling $a_{rh}$ can double $\Delta h$. The value of $a_{rh}$ in parameterized models can only be constrained by numerical convection models. While rheological self-regulation means that there is little leeway on $\delta_{u}$ with the choice of diffusion creep law, increasing $a_{rh}$ allows $\delta_{u}$ to increase, supporting higher $\Delta h$.



\subsection{Implications for planetary systems science}

\label{fig:ocean}
\end{figure}

The effects of topography on the larger workings of the planet are complex and important; indeed, this is a major motivation of our work. As a starting point, we consider that if a planet's peak topography is too low, the entire land area could be submerged more easily by a surface ocean. Figure \ref{fig:ocean} shows the maximum allowable ocean volume before this occurs, approximated as $4\pi/3 \left[(R_p + \Delta h_{peak} )^3 - R_p^3\right]$. The actual volume of surface water depends on the volatile delivery during accretion (a stochastic process) and the cumulative outgassing of the planet (tied strongly to its thermal history). This preliminary calculation shows that massive planets' greater surface area overcomes their lower topography in terms of available surface water storage space. The effect of dynamic topography on subaerial land area may be insignificant for larger planets, especially compared to the effects of water partitioning between the surface and interior \citep{Komacek2016}.



\subsection{Under what conditions is parameterized dynamic topography useful?}

Our preliminary results agree with previous work finding larger dynamic topography at lower Ra and older planet ages \citep{Breuer2015}. Although we have not considered any elastic filtering of topography, thinner elastic lithospheres such as that assumed for Venus also increase the relative importance of dynamic topography at long wavelengths \citep{Golle2012, Dumoulin2013, Breuer2015}.

Meanwhile, on Earth, dynamic topography has neglible effects on the overall hypsometric curve---depending on one's definition, the dynamic component of Earth's topography is not higher than the oceans are deep \citep{Molnar2015, Hoggard2016}. The surface of Venus is thought to be expressing mantle convection, but only in certain areas, and many of its highest-topography regions, such as Ishtar Terra in the north, are consistent with Airy isostasy in terms of their gravity signal \citep{Grimm1991, Yang2016}. So why do we choose to model dynamic topography at all? One reason is that it is requires the lowest-complexity models. Isostasy, conversely, depends on density profiles that require assumptions about petrology. Dynamic topography stems directly from a thermal history model, which would be a required starting point for any geophysical process on exoplanets.

1D parameterized models cannot capture the spatial distribution and possible localization of dynamic topography. The mode of mantle heating affects the planform of convection \citep[e.g.,][]{Choblet2009}, and thus the shape of topographic swells and associated spherical harmonic power spectrum. While internal heating is associated with diffuse upwellings, basal heating leads to broad plumes. Increasing Ra results in narrower upwellings and enhanced localization; topography is higher but more sparse \citep{Bunge1996}. The localization of topographic peaks is important if we are concerned with system-wide consequences that relate to the maximum topography, or how it is distributed on the globe.

%To our knowledge there is no published scaling law for the dynamic topography on a temperature-dependent viscosity, mixed-heating, stagnant lid planet. Although we rely on the present scalings now, we would be interested in learning how wrong they make us.
